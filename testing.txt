aThe explosive increase in number of smart devices hosting sophisticated applications is rapidly affecting the landscapeof information communication technology industry Mobile subscriptions expected to reach 89 billion by 2022  woulddrastically increase the demand of extra capacity with aggregate throughput anticipated to be enhanced by a factor of 1000 In an already crowded radio spectrum it becomes increasingly difcult to meet ever growing application demands of wirelessbandwidth It has been shown that the allocated spectrum is seldom utilized by the primary users and hence contains spectrumholes that may be exploited by the unlicensed users for their communication As we enter the Internet Of Things IoT era inwhich appliances of common use will become smart digital devices with rigid performance requirements such as low latencyenergy efciency etc current networks face the vexing problem of how to create sufcient capacity for such applicationsThe fth generation of cellular networks 5G envisioned to address these challenges are thus required to incorporate cognitionand intelligence to resolve the aforementioned issues Cognitive radios CRs and selforganizing wireless networks are twomajor technologies that are envisaged to meet the future needs of such next generation wireless networksCRs are intelligent and fully programmable radios that can dynamically adapt according to their prevalent environmentIn other words they sense the spectrum and dynamically select the clearer frequency bands for better communication in themost prevailing conditions In this way CRs can adaptively tune their internal parameters to optimize the spectrum usagetransmission waveform channel access methods and modulation schemes with enhanced coverage However it is due to therecent advancements in machine learning software dened radio SDR that CR is able to emerge from simulation environmentto the realtime applications The overwhelming trafc growth coupled with the greedy approach towards high quality of service QoS has been a majorchallenge for current wireless systems in terms of network resources and QoS A new paradigm for wireless communicationcalled 5G has been envisioned to address these challenges The major component of the envisioned 5G scheme is SelfOrganizing Network SON SON is a relatively new concept in perspective of wireless cellular networks it refers to anintelligent network that learns from its immediate environment while autonomously adapting accordingly to ensure reliablecommunication In fact SON underlines new aspect for automation of future networks in 5G eraThe sensing learning and reasoning behavior of both CRs and SON is achieved by extensively using articial intelligenceAI and machinelearning techniques The CRs are an evolved form of SDRs realized by the embodiment of cognitive engineCE that exploits the AI techniques for the cognitive behavior to decide optimallyThe CR network CRN follows the cognitive cycle for unparalleled resource management and better network performanceCognitive cycle as illustrated in gure 1 begins with sensing of dynamic radio environment parameters subsequently observingand learning recursively the sensed values for reconguration of the critical parameters in order to achieve the desired objectiveFig 1 Learning process in cognitive radiosCognitive cycle is elaborated in gure 2 which highlights the parameters that CR needs to quantify in order to utilize theavailable spectrum without affecting primary users performance The sensed parameters are treated as stimuli for achievingdifferent performance objectives for instance minimizing the bit error rate or minimizing the power consumption etc  Toachieve the aforementioned objectives CR adaptively learns deciding optimal values for various signicant variables such aspower control frequency band allocation etc Fig 2 The cognitive cycle of CRCR incorporates machine learning techniques for dynamic spectrum access DSA and capacity maximization AIbasedtechniques for decision making such as optimization theory Markov decision processes MDPs and game theory is used toencompass a wide range of applications  The popular learning techniques used in cognitive cycle are support vector machineSVM articial neural networks ANNs metaheuristic algorithms fuzzy logic genetic algorithms hidden Markov modelsHMMs Bayesian learning reinforcement learning multiagent systems Fuzzy logic theory has been used for effectivebandwidth resource allocation interference and power management     Genetic algorithms GAs have beenemployed for CRs spectrum and parameters optimization    ANNs have been incorporated to improve the spectrumsensing and adaptively learn complex environments without substantial overhead   Game theory enables CRNs tolearn from its history scrutinize the performance of other CRNs and adjust their own behavior accordingly   Inmultiagent domain reinforcement learning RL a rewardpenalty based technique which reinforces immediate rewards tomaximize long term goals has been employed for efcient spectrum utilization  minimum power consumption lling the spectrum holes dynamically  SVM a supervised classication model is being utilized for channel selection adaptation of transmission parameters identify spectrum holes detection  spectrum handoff  and competitive spectrum access  The range of AIbasedtechniques are not limited to the above mentioned applications other applications of AI in CRNs are expressed in   Bycombining increasing spectrum agility context aware adaptability of CR and AI techniques CR has become an increasinglyimportant feature of wireless systems IEEE 80216h has recommended CR as one of its key features and a lot of efforts arebeing made to introduce CR features in 3GPP LTEAdvanceThe rapid proliferation of multiradio access technologydisparate smart devices has resulted in complicated heterogeneousmobile networks thus making conguration management and maintenance cumbersome and errorprone 5G expected tohandle diverse devices at a massive scale is foreseen as one of the most complicated networks and hence extensive efforts arebeing carried out for its standardization In the recent years SONs as depicted in gure 3 have gained signicant attentionregarding selfconguration selfoptimization and selfhealing of such complex networks The idea behind SONs is to automatenetwork planning conguration and optimization jointly in a single process in order to minimize human involvement Theplanning phase which includes ascertaining cells locations intercell connecting links and other associated network devicesas well as parameters precedes the conguration phase  Selfconguration means that a newly deployed cell is able toautomatically congure test and authenticate itself and adjust its parameters such as transmission power intercell interferenceetc in a plug and play fashion  Selfhealing allows troublefree maintenance and enables networks to recover from failuresin an autonomous fashion In addition it also helps in routine upgrades of the equipments in order to remove legacy bugsSelfoptimization is the ability of the network to keep improving its performance with respect to various aspects including linkquality coverage mobility and handoff with an objective to achieve network level goals  Since AIbased techniques arecapable to handle complex problems in large systems intrinsically these techniques are now being proposed to achieve SelfOrganization SO in 5GFig 3 Illustration of AIbased selforganization in the networksSelfconguration in cellular networks refers to the automatic conguration of initial parametersneighbouring cells listFig 4 AI algorithms for 5GIP Addresses and radio access parametersby a node itself AI techniques like Dynamic Programming DP RL and TransferLearning TL may be employed in 5G to automatically congure a series of parameters to render best services RL as opposedto DP which initially builds the environment model to operate is a model free learning technique that iterates through to reachoptimal strategy and may yield superior results in dynamically changing radio conditions  Selfhealing is about automaticfault detection its classication and initiating necessary actions for recovery Irregularities and anomalies in network may betimely spotted to further restore the system by leveraging different AI based sensing techniques like Logistic Regression LRSVM and HMM  Selfoptimization includes continuous optimization of parameters to achieve systemlevel objectives suchas load balancing coverage extension and interference avoidance AI techniques that may be exploited to optimize provisioningof QoS to various services mainly belong to the class of unsupervised learning Besides Gradient Boosting Decision Tree asupervised learning technique Spectral Clustering Oneclass SVM and Recurrent Neural Networks are few examples in thisregard  Figure 4 summarizes the AI algorithms that can be utilized to enhance cellular networks performanceAI techniques may also exploit network trafc patterns to predict future events and help preallocate network resourcesto avoid network overloading Furthermore usercentric QoSprovisioning across tiers of heterogeneous cells may also begranted using AI  Similarly GAs are employed for cell planning and optimization of coverage with power adjustment GAs are also suited for the problem of nding the shortest path routing in a large scale dynamic networks  Wenjinget al in neural network optimization method It integrates fuzzy neural network with cooperative reinforcement learning to jointlyoptimize coverage and capacity by intelligently adjusting power and antenna tilt settings  It adopts a hybrid approach inwhich cells individually optimize respective radio frequency parameters through reinforcement learning in a distributed mannerwhile a central entity manages to cooperate amongst individual cells by sharing their optimization experience on a networklevel  Cells iteratively learn to achieve a tradeoff between coverage and capacity through optimization since increase incoverage leads to reduction in capacity while additionally improving energy efciency of the network  ANNs can also beeffectively utilized for the estimation of link quality  Mobile devices in an indoor environment have also been localizedthrough the use of ANNs  In fact AIbased techniques enable network entities to automatically congure their initiaparameters before becoming operational  adaptively learn radio environment parameters to provide optimal services autonomously perform routine maintenance and upgrades and recover from network failures  In view of the continued proliferation of smart devices we anticipate that CRs and SON will soon become the basicbuilding blocks of future wireless networks These technologies will transform future networks into an intelligent network thatwould encompass user preferences alongside network prioritiesconstraints AI being the basis of both these technologies wicontinue to drive ongoing 5G standardization efforts and therefore be the cause of a major paradigm shift AI techniques wicontinue to intervene future networks nding their usage in from radio resource management to management and orchestrationof networks In fact we anticipate that future wireless networks would be completely dominated by A
