aThe explosive increase in number of smart devices hosting sophisticated applications is rapidly affecting the landscapeof information communication technology industry Mobile subscriptions expected to reach 89 billion by 2022  woulddrastically increase the demand of extra capacity with aggregate throughput anticipated to be enhanced by a factor of 1000 In an already crowded radio spectrum it becomes increasingly difcult to meet ever growing application demands of wirelessbandwidth It has been shown that the allocated spectrum is seldom utilized by the primary users and hence contains spectrumholes that may be exploited by the unlicensed users for their communication As we enter the Internet Of Things IoT era inwhich appliances of common use will become smart digital devices with rigid performance requirements such as low latencyenergy efciency etc current networks face the vexing problem of how to create sufcient capacity for such applicationsThe fth generation of cellular networks 5G envisioned to address these challenges are thus required to incorporate cognitionand intelligence to resolve the aforementioned issues Cognitive radios CRs and selforganizing wireless networks are twomajor technologies that are envisaged to meet the future needs of such next generation wireless networksCRs are intelligent and fully programmable radios that can dynamically adapt according to their prevalent environmentIn other words they sense the spectrum and dynamically select the clearer frequency bands for better communication in themost prevailing conditions In this way CRs can adaptively tune their internal parameters to optimize the spectrum usagetransmission waveform channel access methods and modulation schemes with enhanced coverage However it is due to therecent advancements in machine learning software dened radio SDR that CR is able to emerge from simulation environmentto the realtime applications The overwhelming trafc growth coupled with the greedy approach towards high quality of service QoS has been a majorchallenge for current wireless systems in terms of network resources and QoS A new paradigm for wireless communicationcalled 5G has been envisioned to address these challenges The major component of the envisioned 5G scheme is SelfOrganizing Network SON SON is a relatively new concept in perspective of wireless cellular networks it refers to anintelligent network that learns from its immediate environment while autonomously adapting accordingly to ensure reliablecommunication In fact SON underlines new aspect for automation of future networks in 5G eraThe sensing learning and reasoning behavior of both CRs and SON is achieved by extensively using articial intelligenceAI and machinelearning techniques The CRs are an evolved form of SDRs realized by the embodiment of cognitive engineCE that exploits the AI techniques for the cognitive behavior to decide optimallyThe CR network CRN follows the cognitive cycle for unparalleled resource management and better network performanceCognitive cycle as illustrated in gure 1 begins with sensing of dynamic radio environment parameters subsequently observingand learning recursively the sensed values for reconguration of the critical parameters in order to achieve the desired objectiveFig 1 Learning process in cognitive radiosCognitive cycle is elaborated in gure 2 which highlights the parameters that CR needs to quantify in order to utilize theavailable spectrum without affecting primary users performance The sensed parameters are treated as stimuli for achievingdifferent performance objectives for instance minimizing the bit error rate or minimizing the power consumption etc  Toachieve the aforementioned objectives CR adaptively learns deciding optimal values for various signicant variables such aspower control frequency band allocation etc Fig 2 The cognitive cycle of CRCR incorporates machine learning techniques for dynamic spectrum access DSA and capacity maximization AIbasedtechniques for decision making such as optimization theory Markov decision processes MDPs and game theory is used toencompass a wide range of applications  The popular learning techniques used in cognitive cycle are support vector machineSVM articial neural networks ANNs metaheuristic algorithms fuzzy logic genetic algorithms hidden Markov modelsHMMs Bayesian learning reinforcement learning multiagent systems Fuzzy logic theory has been used for effectivebandwidth resource allocation interference and power management     Genetic algorithms GAs have beenemployed for CRs spectrum and parameters optimization    ANNs have been incorporated to improve the spectrumsensing and adaptively learn complex environments without substantial overhead   Game theory enables CRNs tolearn from its history scrutinize the performance of other CRNs and adjust their own behavior accordingly   Inmultiagent domain reinforcement learning RL a rewardpenalty based technique which reinforces immediate rewards tomaximize long term goals has been employed for efcient spectrum utilization  minimum power consumption lling the spectrum holes dynamically  SVM a supervised classication model is being utilized for channel selection adaptation of transmission parameters identify spectrum holes detection  spectrum handoff  and competitive spectrum access  The range of AIbasedtechniques are not limited to the above mentioned applications other applications of AI in CRNs are expressed in   Bycombining increasing spectrum agility context aware adaptability of CR and AI techniques CR has become an increasinglyimportant feature of wireless systems IEEE 80216h has recommended CR as one of its key features and a lot of efforts arebeing made to introduce CR features in 3GPP LTEAdvanceThe rapid proliferation of multiradio access technologydisparate smart devices has resulted in complicated heterogeneousmobile networks thus making conguration management and maintenance cumbersome and errorprone 5G expected tohandle diverse devices at a massive scale is foreseen as one of the most complicated networks and hence extensive efforts arebeing carried out for its standardization In the recent years SONs as depicted in gure 3 have gained signicant attentionregarding selfconguration selfoptimization and selfhealing of such complex networks The idea behind SONs is to automatenetwork planning conguration and optimization jointly in a single process in order to minimize human involvement Theplanning phase which includes ascertaining cells locations intercell connecting links and other associated network devicesas well as parameters precedes the conguration phase  Selfconguration means that a newly deployed cell is able toautomatically congure test and authenticate itself and adjust its parameters such as transmission power intercell interferenceetc in a plug and play fashion  Selfhealing allows troublefree maintenance and enables networks to recover from failuresin an autonomous fashion In addition it also helps in routine upgrades of the equipments in order to remove legacy bugsSelfoptimization is the ability of the network to keep improving its performance with respect to various aspects including linkquality coverage mobility and handoff with an objective to achieve network level goals  Since AIbased techniques arecapable to handle complex problems in large systems intrinsically these techniques are now being proposed to achieve SelfOrganization SO in 5GFig 3 Illustration of AIbased selforganization in the networksSelfconguration in cellular networks refers to the automatic conguration of initial parametersneighbouring cells listFig 4 AI algorithms for 5GIP Addresses and radio access parametersby a node itself AI techniques like Dynamic Programming DP RL and TransferLearning TL may be employed in 5G to automatically congure a series of parameters to render best services RL as opposedto DP which initially builds the environment model to operate is a model free learning technique that iterates through to reachoptimal strategy and may yield superior results in dynamically changing radio conditions  Selfhealing is about automaticfault detection its classication and initiating necessary actions for recovery Irregularities and anomalies in network may betimely spotted to further restore the system by leveraging different AI based sensing techniques like Logistic Regression LRSVM and HMM  Selfoptimization includes continuous optimization of parameters to achieve systemlevel objectives suchas load balancing coverage extension and interference avoidance AI techniques that may be exploited to optimize provisioningof QoS to various services mainly belong to the class of unsupervised learning Besides Gradient Boosting Decision Tree asupervised learning technique Spectral Clustering Oneclass SVM and Recurrent Neural Networks are few examples in thisregard  Figure 4 summarizes the AI algorithms that can be utilized to enhance cellular networks performanceAI techniques may also exploit network trafc patterns to predict future events and help preallocate network resourcesto avoid network overloading Furthermore usercentric QoSprovisioning across tiers of heterogeneous cells may also begranted using AI  Similarly GAs are employed for cell planning and optimization of coverage with power adjustment GAs are also suited for the problem of nding the shortest path routing in a large scale dynamic networks  Wenjinget al in neural network optimization method It integrates fuzzy neural network with cooperative reinforcement learning to jointlyoptimize coverage and capacity by intelligently adjusting power and antenna tilt settings  It adopts a hybrid approach inwhich cells individually optimize respective radio frequency parameters through reinforcement learning in a distributed mannerwhile a central entity manages to cooperate amongst individual cells by sharing their optimization experience on a networklevel  Cells iteratively learn to achieve a tradeoff between coverage and capacity through optimization since increase incoverage leads to reduction in capacity while additionally improving energy efciency of the network  ANNs can also beeffectively utilized for the estimation of link quality  Mobile devices in an indoor environment have also been localizedthrough the use of ANNs  In fact AIbased techniques enable network entities to automatically congure their initiaparameters before becoming operational  adaptively learn radio environment parameters to provide optimal services autonomously perform routine maintenance and upgrades and recover from network failures  In view of the continued proliferation of smart devices we anticipate that CRs and SON will soon become the basicbuilding blocks of future wireless networks These technologies will transform future networks into an intelligent network thatwould encompass user preferences alongside network prioritiesconstraints AI being the basis of both these technologies wicontinue to drive ongoing 5G standardization efforts and therefore be the cause of a major paradigm shift AI techniques wicontinue to intervene future networks nding their usage in from radio resource management to management and orchestrationof networks In fact we anticipate that future wireless networks would be completely dominated by A

aAbstractFuture communications and data networks are ex
pected to be largely cognitive selforganizing networks CSONSuch networks will have the essential property of cognitive self
organization which can be achieved using machine learning
techniques eg deep learning Despite the potential of these
techniques these techniques in their current form are vulnerable
to adversarial attacks that can cause cascaded damages with
detrimental consequences for the whole network In this paper
we explore the effect of adversarial attacks on CSON Our
experiments highlight the level of threat that CSON have to deawith in order to meet the challenges of nextgeneration networks
and point out promising directions for future workI INTRODUCTIONThe idea that networks should learn to drive themselves is
gaining traction  taking inspiration from selfdriving cars
where driving and related functionality do not require human
intervention The networking community wants to build a
similar cognitive control in networks where networks are able
to congure manage and protect themselves by interacting
with the dynamic networking environmentWe refer to such
networks as cognitive selforganizing networks CSON The ex
pected complexity and heterogeneity of CSON makes machine
learning ML a reasonable choice for realizing this ambitious
goal Recently articial intelligence AI based CSON have
attained a lot of attention in industry and academiaIn 2003 Clark et al Deep ML or deep learning DL is a branch of Mwhere hierarchical architectures of neural networks are used
for unsupervised feature learning and these learned features
are then used for classication and other related tasks Dclassiers are function approximators that require a lot of data
for generalization Although they have outperformed all other
statistical approaches on large datasets due to generalizationerror they are very vulnerable to adversarial examples Adver
sarial examples are carefully crafted perturbations in the input
which when MLDL algorithms are subjected to get classied
in a different class with high probabilityIn this paper we take security to encompass the securing
of all of the functional areas of CSON ie ISO dened func
tional areas often abbreviated as FCAPS fault conguration
accounting performance and security and experiment with
multiple adversarial attacks on MLDL based malware clas
sication systems Our experimental results demonstrate that
the current state of the art MLDL based networking solutions
do not have substantial deterrence against adversarial attacksSpecically our experiments utilize the highly cited malware
image dataset provided by Nataraj et al Contributions In this paper we have made the followingcontributions To the best of our knowledge we have made the rst
attempt to show that CSON utilizing MLDL techniques
are very vulnerable to attacks based on adversarial per
turbations We have argued that existing defenses to overcome ad
versarial perturbations are not appropriate and efcient
for CSON applications We have also highlighted that
protection schemes against adversarial examples create
an arms race between adversariesThe rest of the paper is organized as follow In the next
section we review related research studies that focus on
CSON and adversarial attacks on networking applicationsSection III describes our research methodology particularly
with reference to the dataset the MLDL model used dataset
and threat model assumptions and the adversarial attacksIn Section IV we provide the details of our experimentaevaluations and the potential defense against these attacks In
Section V we discuss the posed questions as well as some
future directions and challenges Finally Section VI concludes
our studyII RELATED WORKMany applications of MLDL in networking have been
proposed in the last few years highlighting the applicationsopportunities and challenges of using MLDL in networking
domain          Although many MLbased solutions for networking appli
cations have been proposed the networking community has
not yet standardized any MLbased solutions for CSONs This
arises partly from the complexity of the CSON environment
that is characterized by dynamically changing network envi
ronment data sparsity expected tussles between control loops
high dimensionality label data scarcity heterogeneity ofine
data processing and many other architectural issuesCSON are expected to resolve the challenges of op
timization conguration healing and coordination in the
communication and data networks by incorporating AIMbased cognitive techniques Latif et al While MLDL applications will be a core part of CSON
recent studies demonstrated that MLDL models are very
susceptible to adversarial examples Such adversarial attacks are performed to compromise the
integrity in terms of misclassication accuracy reduction
targeted misclassication or decision boundary evasion of the
MLDL techniques We can divide these adversarial attacks
into two broader categories based on the adversarysattackers
knowledge Whitebox Attack This attack assumes that the adver
sary has complete knowledge about the MLDL architec
ture training data and hyperparameters For adversariaattacks on CSON we assume a whitebox attack settingthe ad
versaryattacker has no information about the MLDtechnique and hyperparameters The adversary acts as
a standard user who can query the MLDL based system
and gets a response These queryresponse pairs are later Blackbox Attack This attack assumes thatused for crafting the adversarial examplesMost of the adversarial attacks are whitebox attacks but
whitebox adversarial examples can be converted into black
box attacks by exploiting the MLDL transferability property
Since these adversarial attacks on ML algorithms have not
yet been applied much in the case of networks we will initially
review their applications in other domains Szegedy et aAdversarial attacks have not yet been explored for CSON
we will cover some general networking applications In 2013
Corona et al III METHODOLOGYIn this section we describe the approach followed in
designing adversarial examples to evade the MLDL based
malware classication system which we use as a proxy for
the functional areas of CSON To the best of our knowledge
no standardized deep learning based solution for malware
classication in the CSON has been proposed yet In this
work we propose a deep neural network based solution for
malware classication Before delving deep into the details ofFig 1 Depiction of malware executable as an imagethe proposed model we describe the threat model and few
related assumptionsA Threat ModeIn the following we outline the salient assumptions regarding the adversarial threat The adversary may have the knowledge about the trained
model which includes model architecture and hyper
parameters but the adversary cannot make any changes to
the architecture or model parameters This is a common
assumption in the adversarial machine learning domain
 The adversary can only perform attacks during the testing
phase attacks on the training data ie poisoning attacksare not within the scope of this study For malware classication we assume that similar fam
ilies of malware when represented as grayscale images
exhibit similar visual and texture representations This
hypothesis was proposed and defended in  In this
work we utilize convolutional neural networks CNNfor malware classication because CNN is by far the best
feature extractors The goal of an attack is to compromise the integrity
of the MLDL based classication techniques through
a reduction in the classication accuracy with smaperturbationsB Malware Image RepresentationIn this paper we have used grayscale malware image dataset
provided in  where a malware executable is converted
to a grayscale image This approach of conversion includes
both static and dynamic code analysis The executable code
is converted to binary and then represented as 8bit unsigned
vectors these 8bit unsigned vectors are then reshaped to a 2D
array which can be visualized as a grayscale image Figureis depicting the procedure of converting malware executable
to a grayscale imageC Malware Classication ModeWe propose a CNN based malware classication architec
ture Table I depicts the proposed architecture CNN is a pow
erful DL technique that learns spatial feature representations
using convolutional lters CNN has the capability to tolerate
the distortion and spatial shifts in the input data and extract
features from raw input data CNN provides the stateoftheart
solution for network trafc feature extraction and classication
 motivated by these successes we explore the use of CNN
for grayscale malware image classicationIn the proposed architecture we rescale the input grayscale
images of various sizes to 28 pixel wide and 28 pixel highwhere pixel values are between 0 to 255 These input values
are subjected to a twodimensional convolutional layer with
64 lters of receptive eld 14 pixel wide and 14 pixel highAfter that we use a rectied linear unit ie ReLU as an
activation function The resultant activation values are then
passed on to a second convolution layer with 128 lters and
5  5 receptive eld Again we use a ReLU as an activation
function Similarly the third convolution layer follows the
same procedure mentioned earlier but with 128 lters of
1  1 receptive eld After the third convolution layer the
resultant activation values are attened and passed on to a
fully connected layer with softmax as an activation function
producing resulting probabilities We use a variant of the
stochastic gradient descent SGD as an optimization function
and categorical crossentropy as a loss function to train the
CNNTABLE I Proposed CNN architecture for malware classica

the regularization techniques such as dropout and normbased

the FGSM attack3 Jacobianbased Saliency Map Attack Papernot et aJx f xx f jxxiThis attack achieved 97 accuracy by altering only 42 of
the input features Although this attack provides very effective
adversarial examples but it is computationally very expensive
IV EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATIONWe evaluated the CNN based malware classier against
adversarial examples Through our experiments we want to
answer the following questions Question 1 Since MLDL techniques are necessary to
fuel the CSON do these techniques provide the necessary
robustness required to deal with adversarial perturba
tions Question 2 How to build deterrence against adversariaattacks in CSON Question 3 Do the deterrence techniques against ad
versarial examples create an arms race between adver
sariesBefore answering these questions we provide the details of
the dataset used for our experimentsFig 2 Malware image and related features in the imageA DatasetNataraj et al to highlightthatB ResultsWe evaluated the performance of adversarial attacks on
CSON using malware classiers as a proxy The dataset details
are provided in section IVA Both FGSM and BIM attacks
are elementwise attacks with individual perturbation scope
nontargeted specicity and same perturbation magnitude pa
rameter cid15 We performed both attacks using multiple values
of cid15 with 10 50 and 100 epochs Our experimental results
are shown in Tables II and III JSMA is a targeted iterative
Euclidean distance based attack It has two major controlling
parameters namely maximum distortion parameter  and rate
of perturbation in the features  For this experiment we xed
 to be 1 and varied the value of  between 01 02 and
03 for 10 50 and 100 epochs The achieved adversarial test
accuracy values along with the average number of features
perturbed for a successful adversarial example are reported in
Table IV For all aforementioned experiments a batch size of
128 and a learning rate of 0001 were used1 Performance impact The CNN based malware classier
has a classication accuracy of 9839 when trained on
legitimate examples This accuracy is better than the best
accuracy reported on the dataset in consideration Adversariatest examples created by employing FGSM have reduced the
classication accuracy from approximately 99 to 187TABLE II FGSM attack and defense results with different values of epochs and cidEpochsEpsilonFast Gradient Sign Method AttackTest accuracy on

Legitimate Samples in Test accuracy of
Adversarial Examples in Average number of
Features Perturbed which is nearly 97 loss in the accuracy of classication and
prevention against adversarial examples It also means that the
probability of an adversary evading the malware classier has
increased from 1 to 97 which is very alarming Similarly
the BIM attack reduces the test accuracy of adversarial samples
to 09 which is even worse than the FGSM attack In case
of JSMA the classication accuracy decreased from 9828
to 787 but it requires an 8809 of average feature per
turbations to create successful adversarial examples which is
computationally very expensive The full experimental results
are summarized in Tables 2 III and IVMalware classiers are an integral part of the security
architecture of CSON and we demonstrated that a very smaperturbation in the test example has the potential to evade
the integrity of the classier This performance degradation
depicts the potential risks of applying MLDL methods in
the context of CSON without considering the robustness of
MLDL classiers and building proper deterrence against ad
versarial examples Without such deterrence MLDL models
might cause more harm than good in CSON2 Computational complexity Adversarial attacks are not
just random noisevalues added to the test samples Instead
they are carefully calculated perturbations These perturbations
are based on exploiting the inherent generalization error and
gradient variations in of MLDL techniques As the shown in
Table IV detecting and exploiting these errors to make effec
tive adversarial examples is a computationally very complex
and expensive process Since JSMA works on saliency maps
and forward derivatives to nd the most discriminant featuresit becomes computationally very expensive Table IV depicts
the average number of features perturbed to construct an adver
sarial example for each class these values are surprisingly very
high because for each example the underlying data contains
784 features and each feature has a value greater than zero
which is not the case in other standard datasets like MNIST
 This unusual property of the malware image dataset
increases the search space to nd the most discriminating
features thus resulting in rapid increase in that computationacomplexity and poor performance of the JSMA attackC Adversarial DefenseWe need to identify that adversarial settings have been
assumed in networks before through tools such as game theory
but unique challenges emerge and the stakes get higher when
we give more control of the network to ML and algorithms
in CSON  Barreno et al There are two major types of defenses against adversariaexamples namely proactive and reactive Proactive defenses
include adversarial training and network distillation Whereas
reactive defenses include input reconstruction and adversariadetection In this paper we only consider proactive coun
termeasures against adversarial examples More detail about
reactive countermeasures against adversarial examples areexplored in 1 Adversarial Training One countermeasure against ad
versarial examples is to include adversarial examples in the
training data for MLDL techniques Goodfellow et al In this paper we also explored adversariatraining for
making CNN models robust against FGSM and BIM attacksTest accuracies before and after the adversarial training are
reported in Tables II and III The results clearly show that
performing adversarial training can increase the deterrence
against adversarial attacks but it only provides defense against
the adversarial examples on which it is trained while other
adversarial perturbations continue to pose a threat of evading
the integrity of the classier2 Network Distillation Network distillation is another
approach of forming a defense against adversarial examplesHinton et al V DISCUSSIONS CHALLENGES AND FUTURE EXTENSIONSOur experimental results clearly demonstrate that applying
taking into account
MLDL techniques in CSON without
adversarial perturbation threats can potentially lead to major
security risks To date there does not exist any appropriate
solution that provides deterrence against all kinds of adversar
ial perturbations Our experiments answer the questions posed
earlier in Section IV Furthermore they provide the following
insights Robustness of MLDL for CSON In section IVB we
have shown that CSON are very vulnerable to adversariaattacks Sparsity high dimensionality unstructured na
ture unique data packing scheme large salient feature
decision space of network data and less fault tolerance
makes adversarial attacks more lethal for CSON as
compared to other vision and language data Given the
adversarial threat networking community has to come
up with new MLDL mechanism to ensure appropriate
deterrence against adversarial examples Robustness canbe introduced by incorporating approximation and fault
tolerance on top of defense techniques against adversariathreats Deterrence against adversarial attacks in CSON We
have performed proactive defense against adversarial at
tacks by training on adversarial examples This adver
sarial training procedure provides deterrence against the
adversarial examples it is trained on but an unknown
adversarial perturbation can evade the classier Table
II depicts that when the classier is trained via an
adversarial training procedure it enables the malware
classier to classify FGSM based adversarial examples
correctly with 9743 accuracy after 100 epochs but
the same classier was unable to classify BIM attacks
with appropriate accuracy even after 100 epochs of ad
versarial training This shows that before incorporating
MLDL techniques in support of CSON applications like
routing intrusion detection trafc classication malware
detection the research community needs to gure out an
appropriate defense against all adversarial perturbationsThe margin of error in adversarial examples classication
is very narrow in networking application when compared
to computer vision problemsBuilding deterrence against adversarial examples requires
a method to improve generalization this can be achieved
via constraint objective function optimization distributed
denoising and exploiting vicinal risk minimization in
losses Apple Inc MLDL techniques will enable future CSON but before their
deployments the research community has to gure out an
effective way to deal with adversarial attacksA Open issues Standardized datasets Progress in CSON largely de
pends upon learning from data obtained from the user op
erating system and application Unfortunately there does
not exist a single standardized dataset for benchmark
ing MLDL techniques for realtime networking applica
tions In order to ensure a proper utilization of MLDtechniques with efcient deterrence against adversariaexamples networking community has to come up with
standardized datasets for securitycritical applications Learning from untapped network data Building de
terrence in CSON against adversarial examples can be
achieved by improving the generalization of MLDL tech
niques Generalization can be improved by harnessing the
features from untapped networking data network data
that is recorded but not utilized in decision making by
introducing new network telemetry schemes for CSONThis can be a very promising way forward in realizing
security critical CSON New MLDL mechanisms Conventional MLDL tech
niques are very vulnerable to adversarial examples as
shown in section IVB and related defense schemes do not
qualify for CSON applications Developing new MLDschemes for unstructured networking data which are
robust to adversarial threats is still an open avenue Ge
ometric and graph MLDL techniques have the potentiato solve this issue but have not yet been explored in this
contextVI CONCLUSIONIn this paper we evaluated the feasibility of employing
MLDL techniques to realize CSON in security critical appli
cations and their ability to defend against adversarial exam
ples We demonstrated that network data is highly susceptible
to adversarial attacks We also evaluated the proactive defense
mechanisms to build a defense against adversarial perturba
tions Our experiments demonstrate that the application of
MLDL techniques in networking can push the limits on
the stateoftheart in CSON However without taking into
account the threat of adversarial examples signicant security
risks will be a major hindrance to the deployment of these
networks

Machine learning ML especially deep ML schemes have beaten
humanlevel performance in many computer vision language and
speech processing tasks which were considered impossible a decade
ago This success of ML schemes has inspired the ideas of self
driving networks Despite the success of ML in different modern communication
and data networking applications there are some pitfalls in the
fundamental assumptions of ML schemes which can be exploited
by the adversaries to craft adversarial examples in order to com
promise the MLbased system An adversarial example is defined
as an input to the ML model specially crafted by an adversary by
adding a small imperceptible perturbation to the input sample to
compromise the performance of the ML model Mathematically
an adversarial example x  can be formed by adding a typically
imperceptible perturbation  to the legitimate test example x ofPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or

x  f x    t Adversarial examples are possible because of two major faulty
assumptions in ML schemes Firstly the underlying data distribu
tion experienced during the training phase of the ML model wialso be encountered in the testing phase This data stationarity is
not valid for most of the real world cases and the void created by
following this assumption is exploited by the adversary for craft
ing the adversarial examples Secondly most of the ML schemes
are based on the empirical risk minimization ERM which is an
approximation of the actual unknown probability distribution The
ERM has an associated error with it which can be exploited by the
adversary to make an adversarial exampleAdversarial attacks can be classified broadly into whitebox and
blackbox attacks based on the knowledge of the adversary about
the deployed ML model In a whitebox attack it is assumed that
adversary has complete knowledge hyperparameters test data
etc of the deployed model whereas in a blackbox attack no such
knowledge is assumed and it is assumed that the adversary can
only act as a standard user and query the system for a responseIn this paper we have taken modulation classification which
is an important component of modern communication and data
networks as a proxy of functional areas of cognitive selfdriving
networks We have performed a blackbox adversarial attack on
DNNbased modulation classification to highlight the brittleness of
ML schemes utilized in cognitive selfdriving networks2 RELATED WORK

procedure illustrated in Figure 1 The steps followed are 1 the
adversary queries the deployed modulation classifier with test ex

response to the adversary considering the adversary as a normauser 3 the adversary stores the queryresponse pair in a database
which is later used as a substitute dataset for training a surrogate
DNN 4 once sufficient data is collected in the adversarial database
the adversary constructs a fully connected DNN model and trains it
for suitable classification performance 5 once the surrogate DNN
is trained the adversary launches a CW attack on the surrogate
DNN for crafting adversarial examples that compromises the per
formance of the surrogate DNN model 6 adversarial examples that
compromises the performance of surrogate DNNmodel are then
transferred to blackbox DLbased modulation classifier which ac
cording to the transferability property of adversarial examples wicompromise the performance of DLbased modulation classifierSince we are performing this experiment in lab settings we have
opted for training two modulation classifiers based on CNN and
LSTM and then considered them as blackbox models We have
used highlycited GNU radio ML RML201610a dataset provides 11 digital and analog modulation schemes on the SNR
ranging from 20 dB to 18dB We have used only 10 of the test
examples to construct the surrogate classifier and then performed
CW attack the performance of the surrogate DNN model before
and after the attack is provided in Figure 1 Once the adversariaattack on surrogate DNN is completed we have transferred the
adversarial examples that evaded the surrogate DNN to blackbox
modulation classifier by leveraging the transferability property of
adversarial ML The performance impact of the adversarial attack
is provided in Figures 1 and 2 A clear drop in the accuracy of the
modulation classifier after the adversarial attack highlights that our

aAbstractDeep Neural Networks DNN have been widely
adopted in selforganizing networks SON for automating differ
ent networking tasks Recently it has been shown that DNN lack
robustness against adversarial examples where an adversary can
fool the DNN model into incorrect classication by introducing a
small imperceptible perturbation to the original example SON is
expected to use DNN for multiple fundamental cellular tasks and
many DNNbased solutions for performing SON tasks have been
proposed in the literature have not been tested against adversariaexamples In this paper we have tested and explained the
robustness of SON against adversarial example and investigated
the performance of an important SON use case in the face
of adversarial attacks We have also generated explanations
of incorrect classications by utilizing an explainable articiaintelligence AI techniqueIndex TermsAdversarial machine learning Self OrganizingCellular NetworksI INTRODUCTIONDriven by ambitious bandwidth and latency targets and the
development of new domains such as IoT and connected vehi
cles 5G networks are becoming increasingly complex as they
incorporate disparate emerging trends such as network densi
cation and coexistence with existing cellular technologiesThese networks also perform several challenging activities
such as planning dimensioning deployment testing network
optimization comprehensive performance monitoring failure
detection failure correction and general maintenancewhich
currently utilize large human resources in the loop This
results in a network that
is both costlythus dissatisfying
for the cellular operator and errorpronebringing customer
dissatisfaction and resulting in increased churn In such scenarios articial intelligence AI driven self
organized networks provides an attractive alternative by
providing the tools for performing automation with self
organization and intelligence The main objectives of the SON
are to build an intelligent network that can guarantee the net
work resilience with reduced complexity simplied network
management and properly optimized network congurations
 SON technology leverages advance in machine learning
ML and deep learning DL techniques to overcome the
multiple challenges of operating modern network through their
integral capability of handling and analyzing big dataEven though ML and DL models can greatly outperform
traditional methods in obtaining excellent accuracy in benign
environments it is also important to verify the robustness ofthese models in adversarial settings particularly since it has
been shown in recent work that adversarial examples can be
generated by malicious adversaries to fool the DL models very
easily by applying small perturbations to the original inputs
  More formally an adversarial sample x is created
by following the equation 1 where imperceptible perturbation
is denoted as  legitimate test example is denoted as x the
deployed trained classier is described by f  and t describes
the wrong class adversary wants to achievex  x  arg min

and this lack of transparency can be a major drawback for
the security critical domains Hence explainable AI XAor blackbox model interpretability plays an important part
in mitigating this threat of adversaries Tomsett et al in the domain of SON Demonstrated that the explainable AI and adversarial Mare linked with each other and adversarial ML can be used
to describe feature representations of a DNN mode To the best of our knowledge this study is rst in the
domain of SON to test adversarial machine learning

network optimization is a continuous process of planning
parametric conguration changes operations and maintenance
with the help of large human interventions Therefore the
SON is introduced as an intelligent network that provides
scalability agility and stability to maintain the operators and
consumers desired objectives  A fundamental property of
the SON is the ability to interact and learn from the networking
environment to adapt to the changing circumstancesThree main functions of SON selfconguration self
healing and selfoptimization perform these automatic tasks
 Selfconguration manages tasks of automatic congura
tion of cellular network nodes The main use cases are plan
ning and modifying the radio and transport parameters Self
optimization manages solutions that target cellular network
performance optimization based on the operator specicationsThe main use cases of this category are handover parameters
optimization QoSrelated parameters optimization and load
balancing Whereas selfhealing manages tasks to automatic
detection and rectication of failures in networkIn the context of cellular systems DNNs are applied in
all three categories of SON Feng et al An adversary can affect DNN models of SON through
internal and external attacks In the case of internal attacks
adversaries can corrupt training data and classiers of DNN
models of SON directly However these internal attacks are
not easily possible due to the difcult task of adding adver
sarial examples directly into the input of the DNN modeWhereas external attacks can utilize vulnerabilities of data
collection process of cellular networks Base stations collect
measurement reports and pass it SON function that uses this
collected data to implement its different functionalities for
network optimization Adversarial examples can be injected
into this data collection process with the help of a rogue
base station Shaik et al fake data into the SON ecosystem with the help of a rogue
base station There work is mainly concerning DoS attacks on
cellular networks and user devicesB Adversarial Attacks on SONs and Cognitive NetworksMost of the current research of adversarial machine learning
is relevant to computer vision tasks such as Szegedy et al   cid15signxjxWhereas JSMA is based on the concept of saliency mapsThis algorithm tries to nd input dimensions or features that
are most vulnerable due to possible perturbations by creating
a saliency map and an iterated process to nd misclassication
in the modeJx f xx f jxxiSome recent studies of adversarial examples are performed
in the eld of network intrusion detection systems NIDSIn these studies signicant degradation in accuracy is ob
served for intrusion detection systems after exposing DNNs
to adversarial examples  Whereas Usama et al C Adversarial Defense MethodsMany methods have been proposed for making ML models
more robust and mitigating adversarial examples AdversariaTraining D Explainable ACurrent work of explainable AI or blackbox model inter
pretability lies within two categories global and local inter
pretability Global interpretability describes the understanding
of the whole logic of a model and follows the entire reasoningleading to all the different possible outcomes Whereas locainterpretability is used to generate an individual explanation to
justify why the model made a specic decision for an instance
 Some recent studies explored the link between XAand AML Tomsett et al III METHODOLOGYIn this section we will describe our procedure for perform
ing two types of adversarial attacks on abnormal KPI detector
but before that we will describe the threat model and the
dataset used in this experimentA Threat ModeThis subsection describes the major assumptions considered
for performing an adversarial attack on the use case of SON1 Adversary Knowledge We have used two whitebox
attack algorithms which mean adversary has complete
knowledge about the model architecture features and
test data2 Adversarial Goals and Defense Our goal in this ex
periment is to check the vulnerabilities of SON against
adversarial examples We have achieved this by measur
ing accuracy before and after implementing attacks We
have experimentally validated a defensive technique to
mitigate the effect of adversarial examplesB SON Use Case  Detection of Abnormal KPFigure 1 states the generic ow chart of SON methodology
consisting of its main use cases of selfoptimization and Self
conguration of a LTE Long Term Evolution network Two main functions of LTE architecture are i Evolved Uni
versal Terrestrial Radio Access Network EUTRAN and iiEvolved Packet Core EPC EUTRAN consists of multiple
base stations termed as eNodeB and User Equipment UEUE is typically a smartphone or an IoT device for using caor data services after setting up a connection to a cell of the
cellular network A Cell is a specic terrestrial area controlled
by each eNodeBKey Performance Indicators KPIs explain the quality of
services QoS and quality of experience QoE of these
connected devices For example KPIs that are relevant to
call or data services setup and services completion belong to
Accessibility and Retainability classes of KPIs respectivelyThe calculation of these KPIs is based on the measurement
reports which are collected through various internal and
external data collection methods SON continuously monitorsthese KPIs and in case of any abnormality automatically starts
relevant optimization and conguration tasksSON Methodology Flow Chart SON function continuously
Figuremonitors the KPIs and starts automatic optimization and conguration actions
based on KPI measurementsERAB Drop Rate is one of the signicant KPIs to judge
user experience and belongs to the retainability class of KPIsEffective and timely detection of this indicator is essential to
avoid users churn Brief description of this KPI is mentioned
belowWhen a User Equipment UE has data to send or receive
it sets up an end to end communication channel called EPS
Radio Access Bearer ERAB between itself and the core
network part of EPC This ERAB is the access layer bearer for
carrying service data of a UE After the utilization of cellular
services UE releases its Radio Access Bearer RAB This
RAB is considered as a drop if it is released abnormally ieongoing session is dropped requiring the user to initiate a new
connection to resume services This drop rate is measured as a
fraction of the total number of abnormal releases with normareleasesERAB Drop Rate   100 ERAB Abnormal Releases
ERAB N ormal ReleasesC Dataset and Data PreprocessingFor the use case of ERAB Drop Rate detection records
are extracted from live LTE network Each row contains an
hourly record of a specic eNodeB with a sudden increase in
ERAB Drop Rate is labeled as an anomaly Initial experiments
involve total 4464 records of two LTE eNodeBs 3940 records
are labeled as normal and 524 as anomalies based on domain
knowledge Each sample has 22 features which are divided
into three main categories of i time and location ii de
pendent features ERAB drop reasons and iii independent
features signal strengths latency and the number of usersThis dataset has binary and nominal data variables and we
have applied onehot encoding to convert nominal features numeric features since DNNs cannot operate on nominal data
directly This resulted in the transformation of the 25feature
dataset into a 26feature dataset after onehot encodingAfter analyzing the data we have noticed varying distri
butions of each feature For example the mean and standard
distribution of some features are larger by seven orders of
magnitude from some other features Without performing
normalization these features would dominate other featuresTo mitigate this effect we have used minmax scaling using
Scikitlearn library to normalize data For our use case of
anomaly detection in the dataset of ERAB Drop Rate we have
used Multilayer Perceptron MLP classier with the activation
function of ReLU using Keras and Tensorow sequentiamodel The MLP model is composed of three hidden layers
of 256 neural units The output layer contains two neurons
since labels have two normal and abnormal classes For
regularization dropout with a rate of 04 and earlystopping
is usedIV PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONIn this section we have provided a detailed evaluation ofour experiment resultsA Evaluation MetricWe have used accuracy for performance evaluation of
results Accuracy is dened as the percentage of correctly
classied records over the total number of records After
training the DNN model and testing its accuracy we have
implemented both FGSM and JSMA attacks for evaluation of
the impact of adversarial examples at the dataset Accuracy is
again measured after implementation of Adversarial Training
as a defensive techniqueB Experiment Results1 Impact on Accuracy Figure 1 and gure 2 describe the
experimental results after implementing adversarial examples
and defensive technique of adversarial training at the dataset It
is clear that adversarial examples have signicantly degraded
the performance of DNNs used in SON We have observed
JSMA caused more performance degradation than FGSMHowever JSMA requires more computation time for crafting
an adversarial example Our results in gure 1 and 2 also
depict the performance of DNNbased abnormal KPI after
the adversarial training It is evident from the results that
adversarial training has performed better against FGSM as
compared to JSMA2 Features Explanations Most affected features are calcu
lated through the technique mentioned in  We have ranked
and sorted the features with their importance after generating
the adversariatest set This importance is calculated by
subtracting the original test set from the adversarial test setThe indexes where adversaries have no impact

of this subtraction is zero However for indexes which are
affected by the attack the value of this subtraction is nonzeroBy calculating these nonzero values most affected features
are calculatedFigure 2 Performance of abnormal KPI detector before and after FGSM
attack The gure also provides the results of adversarial training which tells
the recovery of the abnormal KPI detectorFigure 3 Performance of abnormal KPI detector before and after JSMA
attack The gure also provides the results of adversarial training which tells
the recovery of the abnormal KPI detectorAs expected FGSM changed almost all features 22 out of
25 However it is not possible to avoid human observation
when the scale of the adversary is on such a large leveWhereas JSMA changed six features and degraded the perfor
mance of model badly We have observed the most affected
features and compared them with the domain knowledge of
cellular networks For instance we have an understanding
from the dataset that most of the ERAB drops are due to the
transport network layer TNL problems and almost identicafeatures of TNL drops are observed after examining the most
vulnerable features by JSMA attackV CONCLUSIONSIn this paper we have performed FGSM and JSMA attack
on DNNbased abnormal KPI detector Our results indicate
more than 60 drop in the performance of DNNbased
abnormal KPI detector making it very evident that DNN used
for detection does not provide robustness against adversariaperturbation A prominent recovery in the performance of
abnormal KPI detector is noticed after we have used adver
sarial training as a defense against adversarial examples We
have also provided the reasons why adversarial attacks are soeffective against abnormal KPI detector by utilizing insights
from explainable AI Our results also trhow the light on a
previously ignored area of machine learning security in the
SON and provide good insights for developing a robust ML
based SON solution

aAbstractModulation classication is an important component
of cognitive selfdriving networks Recently many MLbased
modulation classication methods have been proposed We have
evaluated the robustness of 9 MLbased modulation classiers
against the powerful Carlini  Wagner CW attack and showed
that the current MLbased modulation classiers do not provide
any deterrence against adversarial ML examples To the best
of our knowledge we are the rst to report the results of the
application of the CW attack for creating adversarial examples
against various ML models for modulation classicationIndex TermsAdversarial machine learning Modulation classicationI INTRODUCTIONThe success of machine learning ML in computer vi
sion and speech processing has motivated the networking
community to consider deploying ML for the automation of
networking operations Recently new networking paradigms
like cognitive selfdriving networks Although ML schemes especially deep neural networks
DNN have outperformed traditional networking schemes in
many networking tasks it has been shown recently that DNN
and other ML schemes lacks robustness against adversariaexamples which are dened as inputs to the ML modespecially crafted by an adversary to cause a malfunction in
the performance of the ML model These adversarial examples
are generated by adding small typicallyimperceptible pertur
bations to the legitimate examples for the express purpose of
misleading the ML model towards the production of wrong
results and to increase the prediction error of the modeBased on the adversarys knowledge adversarial attacks are
classied into two major categories whitebox attacks and
blackbox attacks In whitebox attacks it is assumed that
the adversary has perfect knowledge about the victim model
whereas in blackbox attacks it is assumed that adversary has
no information about the victim model and the adversary can
only query the deployed ML model for a response and to later
use this information for crafting adversarial examplesMore formally an adversarial example x is crafted by
adding a small imperceptible perturbation  to the test example
x of the deployed trained classier f  The perturbation is computed by approximating iteratively the nonlinear
optimization problem given in equation 1 until the crafted
adversarial example gets classied by the trained ML classier
f  in a wrong class tx  x  arg min
xcid107cid107  f x    tAdversarial examples are a direct consequence of an unsafe
assumption in ML that distribution encountered by the Mmodel in training phase will also be encountered in the test
phase of the ML modeThe effects of adversarial ML examples in cognitive self
driving networks have not been explored properly in the
literature In this paper we have performed an adversariaattack on ML classiers performing the task of modulation
classication which is an important application in cogni
tive selfdriving networks Our results clearly highlight that
a small optimallycalculated adversarial perturbation for the
test example can cause a serious drop in performance of
the classication output of the ML model This paper also
highlights the vulnerability and brittleness associated with the
ML models used in the cognitive selfdriving networksThe major contributions of this work are We have performed an adversarial ML attack on 9 ML
based modulation classiers to highlight the vulnerability
of these modulation classiers to adversarial perturbation
 We demonstrate the transferability phenomenon in the
setting of modulation classiers by showing that an
adversarial example compromising one ML scheme wialso be to evade other ML schemes with high probability
 To this best of our knowledge this is the rst experiment
where the Carlini  Wagner CW attack The rest of the paper is organized as follows In the next sec
tion we will provide a brief review of the related research that
focuses on MLbased modulation classication and adversariaattacks on modulation classication Section III describes the
methodology where we have discussed the assumed threat
model MLmodels used for modulation classication and the
utilized adversarial attack for crafting adversarial examplesSection IV provides the performance evaluation of the ad
versarial attack on the modulation classication Section V
concludes the study and provides future directionsII RELATED WORKA Modulation classication using ML schemesThe recent success of ML in computer vision and cyber
physical systems has inspired a surge in the utilization of Mschemes in wireless and data networks It is conceived that Mwill be the backbone of future cognitive selfdriving networksModulation classication is an important problem in dynamic
spectrum allocation of cognitive selfdriving networks There
are few MLbased modulation classication schemes available
in the literature Wong et al Muller et al B Adversarial attacks on MLbased modulation classication
There has not been much work available on exploring the
threat of adversarial ML examples on modulation classica
tion Sadeghi et al   cid15signxjxFlowers et al Most of the results of the adversarial attacks reported on
modulation classication have used FGSM attack without con
sidering that FGSM was not designed to generate the optimaamount of adversarial perturbation it was only designed with
an absolute motivation of generating adversarial perturbations
quickly rather than optimally  In this paper we have
performed CW attack III METHODOLOGY
In this section we describe our procedure for performing an
adversarial attack on modulation classication To the best of
our knowledge there is no standardized MLbased solution for
modulation classication in the cognitive selfdriving networks
available yet in the literature so for completeness we have
used both conventional and deep ML schemes for modulation
classication Before delving deep into the details of the
MLmodels used for modulation classication and adversariaattack on it we describe the threat model and a few related
assumptionsA Threat modeThis subsection describes the major assumptions consideredfor performing adversarial attack on modulation classier1 Adversary Knowledge We have assumed a whitebox
settings for performing an adversarial attack on DNN based
modulation classication which means adversary has the
complete knowledge about
the model architecture related
hyperparameters and the test data This assumption is fairly
standard in the adversarial ML domain We have transferred
the adversarial examples for DNNbased modulation classier
to other conventional MLbased modulation classiers In this
paper we have only assumed test time adversarial attacksPoisoning attacks are left for future considerations2 Adversarial Goals Our goal in this experiment is to
compromise the integrity of the modulation classier through
adversarial examples and the success of the adversarial attack
in this paper will be measured by the comparison of the
accuracy before and after the adversarial attackB Modulation Classication ModelsWe have used DNN KNN SVM Nave Bayes NB linear
discriminant analysis LDA Decision Tree DT random
forest RF and ensemble methods for modulation classi
cation To the best of our knowledge this is the rst paper
that uses almost all the famous ML schemes for modulation
classication and then performs adversarial ML attack on these
schemes to highlight that conventional ML deep ML and
ensemble methods do not provide robustness against smacarefullycrafted perturbationsFor the DNN classier we have used four dense hidden
layers network with rectied linear units as a nonlinear
activation in hidden layers and softmax for calculating the
classication probabilities of each class Stochastic gradient
descent SGD has been used as an optimizer and categoricacrossentropy as the associated loss function for training the
DNN based modulation classier For the KNN classier we
have used 15 neighbors as an optimal number of neighbors for
performing the classication We have used radial basis func
tion RBF kernel for performing the SVM based modulation
classication For the NB classier we have assumed Gaussian
distribution as the underlying modulation data distribution For
the LDAbased classication we have used singular valuedecomposition SVD solver as an SVD solver can better
handle a large number of modulation data features For the
DT classier we have used maximum unfolding depth offor achieving good classication result For the RF classier
we have a maximum of 10 trees forest for estimating the
classication results For ensemble methods for modulation
classication we have employed AdaBoost and Gradient
Boosting algorithms The obtained classication results are
provided in section IVC Adversarial attackWe have performed CW We have used L2based CW attack for crafting adversariaexamples Instead of formulating the adversarial ML problem
as in equation 1 which is highly nonlinear formulation that
is difcult to optimize an alternative formulation provided
in equation 3 where gx is the new objective function such
that gx  0 iff gx  t here t can be any label but the
true label is used by the the CW attack that can be solved
by gradient descent The best performing objective function
g used for crafting adversarial examples for modulation
classication is provided in equation 4 where Z denotes the

cid107cid107P  cgxsuch thatx  0 1ngx  max0 max
icid54tZxi  ZxtWe have only opted to use an L2based adversarial attack
because we want to keep the perturbation  to a minimum
while minimizing the squared error between adversarial mod
ulation example and the original modulation exampleMany defenses against adversarial examples have been
proposed in literature but this powerful attack has beaten aof them In our experiments we wish to achieve the followingobjectives Objective 1 Do the ML schemes used for modulation
classication in the literature provide necessary robust
ness against adversarial perturbations Objective 2 We want to experimentally verify that the
adversarial examples breaching one ML schemes wibreach other ML models with high probability even if
the deployed ML model is unknownBefore explaining how we have met these objectives through
our experiment in the next section we provide a detailed
description of the dataset used for performing the experimentsD DatasetWe have used highly cited GNU radio ML RML201610a
dataset For this experiment we have used eight digital modulation
schemes and excluded three analog modulation schemes The
excluded schemes are AMDSB AMSSB and WBFM The
total number of examples used in these experiments isEach example is a 256 size vector with 128 inphase andquadraturephase components This dataset was generated for
20 different SNR levels from 20 dB to 18 dB More details
of the dataset preparations can be found in IV PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section we have provided a detailed evaluation
of the MLbased modulation classiers against adversariaperturbationsA Performance ImpactWe have evaluated the MLbased modulation classication
before and after the adversarial attack We have used the
accuracy as the performance metric the decay in the modu
lation classication describes the adversarial attack successFigure 1 provides a detailed comparison of accuracy and SNR
before and after the adversarial attack The clear drop in the
accuracy of the classiers with increasing SNR fullls the
rst objective of this experiment where we set out to show
that the MLschemes proposed in the literature for modulation
classication does not provide the necessary robustness against
adversarial examplesB Transferability of Adversarial ExamplesHere we want to note that adversarial examples were only
crafted for DNNbased modulation classier under white
box assumptions The adversarial examples compromising
the integrity of the DNN classiers were transferred to the
rest of ML classiers under blackbox assumptions and it
turns out that modulation classiers based on conventionaML techniques are also equally vulnerable to the adversariaexamples which fulll the second objective we wanted to
achieve through this experimentV CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we have highlighted the lack of robustness
of MLmodels utilized in modulation classication by suc
cessfully evading 9 different MLbased modulation classiersWe have also successfully shown that transferability of the
adversarial examples from one model to another model for
performing the adversarial attack This work has also provided
a glimpse of the security and robustness issues associated
with the utilization of ML models in cognitive selforganizing
networks Designing new defenses against adversarial attacks
on cognitive selfdriving networks are left as a future directionFigure 1 The accuracy of ML models used for modulation classication before and after adversarial ML attack is provided in the gure A clear drop in the
accuracy with improving SNR after the adversarial attack clearly indicates the lack of deterrence against small carefully crafted adversarial perturbations

devices in the coming years motivates the development
of efcient algorithms that can help in their effective
management while keeping the power consumption low In
this paper we propose an intelligent multichannel resource
allocation algorithm for dense LoRa networks termed as
LoRaDRL and provide a detailed performance evaluationOur results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not
only signicantly improves LoRaWANs packet delivery
ratio PDR but is also able to support mobile enddevices
EDs while ensuring lower power consumption hence
increasing both the lifetime and capacity of the networkMost previous works focus on proposing different MAC
protocols for improving the network capacity

RaWAN delay before transmit etc We show that through
the use of LoRaDRL we can achieve the same efciency
with ALOHA compared to LoRaSim and LoRaMAB
while moving the complexity from EDs to the gateway thus
making the EDs simpler and cheaper Furthermore we test
the performance of LoRaDRL under largescale frequency
jamming attacks and show its adaptiveness to the changes
in the environment We show that LoRaDRLs output
improves the performance of stateoftheart techniques
resulting in some cases an improvement of more than 500

Reinforcement Learning DRL and Cognitive NetworksI INTRODUCTIONThe count of InternetofThing IoT devices is antic
ipated to increase manifold in the coming years These
nonuniformly distributed dense networks will include
enddevices EDs moving with different velocities This
puts forward a need for effective algorithms able to
manage all those devices while keeping the collisions
and the energy consumption as low as possible Long
Range LoRa is a leading Low Power Wide Area Net
work LPWAN technology and LoRaWAN is a leading
LPWA networking protocol for LoRa LoRa uses the
Chirp Spread Spectrum CSS technique which i is
resilient to interference ii uses low power iii is resis
tant to multipath fading iv is resistant to the Dopplereffect and v has low communication link budget LoRaWAN networks need a small infrastructure to be
deployed and their scalability can be increased by adding
more gateways to the network This makes LoRaWAN
an attractive lowcost IoT solution for transmitting data
from the ED to the user and control commands from the
user to the EDBroadly speaking there are two critical factors that
decide the usefulness of LPWAN i better lifetime
and ii network capacity ie the maximum number
of EDs supported by the network Battery lifetime is

layer parameters in LoRaWAN can help to increase
the network scalability of LoRa networks by decreasing
the number of collisions among signals coming from
multiple EDs hence increasing their ability to coexistThe network capacity of the LoRaWAN can also be
increased by increasing the number of LoRa gateways
and reducing the overhearing of transmissions to other
gateways by their strategic placementIn LoRaWAN a communication channel is observed
by the ED and in case of the channel being busy
the PHYlayer parameters specically the spreading
factor SF and the channel frequency are adjusted
reactively The SFs are partially orthogonal and EDs
using different SF values can transmit simultaneously
 However such a reactive approach is not appropriate
for lowpower EDs because before any parameters se
lectionadjustment algorithm is invoked several packets
would have been retransmitted or lost Moreover the
time delay inherent in the reactive approach is also not
acceptable in situations where decision making has to
be done in a bounded time Hence there is an absolute
need for a proactive
intelligent and adaptive PHY
layer transmission parameters adjustment algorithm forv




aLoRaWANThe presence of a large number of IoT devices in
creases both the intranetwork and internetwork inter
ference causing a performance drop  The integration
of cognitive radio technology into the LoRaWAN stan
dard can signicantly reduce the energy consumption
and increase the network capacity  A LoRaWAN
gateway can decode multiple simultaneous transmissions
based on different PHYlayer transmission parametersMoreover existing research focuses on a static associa
tion between the resources of the IoT and the surround
ing real environment IoT is extremely dynamic in nature
and may experience unpredictable mobility resulting in
sudden variations of communication capabilitiesinvolves the addition of noise to a signaAlso the inherent broadcast nature of wireless com
munications makes them vulnerable to internetwork in
terference and adversarial attacks Jamming of a wireless

signadecrease the signal to noise ratio It differs from the
normal interference in terms of its purpose LoRaWAN
uses encryption techniques that only secure the packet
content leaving the transmissions vulnerable  
and As the networks are anticipated to become denser
in the coming years both the frequency jamming and
dynamicity problems will become more severe In case
of being deployed in realnetworks the performance
PDR and energy consumption of LoRa network is also
affected by interference coming from other deployed
networks in the area This internetwork interference can
cause severe performance drop if not managed There is
a need for algorithms that can sense this performance
drop and hence adjust the frequencies to minimize the
effect of internetwork interferenceAdaptive selection of the PHYlayer parameters in
dense LoRa networks can be performed using ef
cient algorithms hence enabling collisionfree concurrent
transmissions  The intelligent selection of parameters
not only reduces the impact of frequency jamming
attacks but also causes a signicant drop in energy con
sumption because of fewer retransmissions required due
to lost or collided packets For this purpose we proposed
a deep reinforcement learning DRLbased PHYlayer
parameters selection scheme for dense LoRa networks in
our previous work  In that article we evaluated our
proposed technique in uniformly distributed scenarios
with different percentages of intelligent devices and
with different power levels We showed our technique to
be not only able to achieve a high PDR but also reduce
energy usageIn this paper we build upon our previous work TABLE I Important Acronyms used in the paperBW

Medical ISM frequency band LoRaWAN architecture
consists of LoRa end devices EDs LoRa gateways
network servers and application user servers A basic
LoRaWAN architecture containing transmitting EDs
gateway and network server has been shown in FigThe applications of deployed LoRa EDs in LoRaWAN
can be either eventdriven or scheduled The former one
involves the transmission of data whenever a specic
event occurs while the latter involves transmissions on
scheduled intervals Parking sensors in parking lots to
sense the available parking spaces are an example of
eventdriven EDs while the temperature sensors mounted
at the top of buildings to measure the temperature of the
area exemplify scheduled transmittersIn LoRa a transceiver can select a bandwidth BW in
the range 78 to 500 kHz and mostly a LoRa transceiver
operates at 125 kHz 250 kHz or 500 kHz Spreading
Factor SF denes the ratio between the symbol rate and
the bandwidth LoRa provides seven SF rates to choosFig 1 Architecture of LoRaWAN consisting of LoRa EDs LoRa gateway network server and enduser The EDs serve different purposes and transmit the data
to the gateway based on the application requirements The received data packets are forwarded to the network server which in turn forwards them to the enduserfrom SF6 to SF12 By modifying the SF parameter
we make a tradeoff between the communication range
and the data rate As discussed before that

they can be used to
values are partially orthogonal
make multiple simultaneous communications possible
with minimum collisions Coding rate CR denes the
level of protection against interference LoRa denes
7 four coding rates8  A LoRa radio can transmit
between 4 to 20 dBm in 1 dB steps However due
to hardware limitations the mentioned range is mostly
limited between 2 to 20 dBm The useful bit rate Rbis given as6 5 Rb  SF BW
2SF   CRThis shows that the useful bit rate is directly propor
tional to BW  CR and inversely to SF LoRaWAN
provides 3 transmission classes to satisfy the require
ments of different applications namely class A class
B and class C Class A is the most energyefcient
class and is normally used in batterypowered devicesIn class A
there are two downlink communication
slots after each uplink transmission Class B involves
scheduled downlink communication slots and is less
energyefcient than class A In class C the downlink
communication is always active and hence this class is
the least energy efcient Normally class C devices are
connected directly to the main power To get a broader

B Deep Reinforcement Learning DRThe rapid evolution of deep learning DL and compu
tational technologies have enabled the conventional Rto solve the complex sequential decision problem which
is previously deemed impossible due to dimensionality
issues A combination of DL with legacy RL is knownas DRL Mnih et al Equation 2 provides a detailed description of DQNQs a  Rs a   max acid48 Qscidcid awhere scid48 is the next state acid48 is the next action R is
the reward of a stateaction pair Q is the Qvalue of the
stateaction pair and  is the discount factor The policy
 in DQN is to take the action with the maximum Q
value at a specic state ie Qs a  maxa Qs aand is represented by the DNNWhy DRL In case of normal Qlearning a Qtable is
built to store the Qvalues corresponding to each state
action pair This table can only be built when the state
space and actionspace are both discrete In case any
of them is continuous the size of the table increases
exponentially with each possible value of actions and
states DQN C Related WorkA number of different PHYlayer parameters selection
algorithms for LoRaWAN have been proposed so far discuss the stateoftheart algorithms only There are
two major schemes for handling dense LoRa networksi by scheduling the transmissions and ii by an
efcient selection of PHYlayer parameters In 2016
Kim et al Bor et al Bianchi et al Abdelfadeel et al The LoRa network community has also utilized DRschemes for automating different tasks such as load bal
ancing CSMACA They train different deep neural networks
DNNs for each LoRa ED which is resourceintensiveOur technique is only based on training a single DNN
for the whole network Also the learning of each of
the DNN proposed by Farhad et al Aggarwal and Nassipuri Chinchilla et al Ta et al 1 LoRaMAB is exponentially complex in terms of
its computational complexity and hence not fea
sible for dense LoRa networks The convergence
time of the algorithm is high and is bound to
increase with an increase in the count of EDs2 It does not account for the mobility of EDs This
makes it inapplicable in a network consisting of
mobile EDs such as healthcare smart vehiclesaging society and postemergency networks3 The focus on optimizing power consumption is not
done properly Due to a missing specialized objec
tive function EDs have the option of choosing any
of the available power levels without particularly
focusing on saving power This random choice
does not always lead to the optimal power leveselection4 The computations are being performed at the EDs
without considering the power limitations in the
case of batterypowered EDs5 To reduce the complexity of the problem LoRa
MAB reduces the action space of individual EDs
based on their distance from the gateway In case
the EDs are mobile a change in their position
makes the learning suboptimaWe refer the reader to In our previous work  we showed that the perfor
mance deteriorates in a LoRaMAB based system when
EDs are mobile In this paper we perform further ex
periments with LoRaDRL III SYSTEM SETUPWe have previously described the working of our
DDQNbased adaptive PHYlayer parameter selection
algorithm for dynamically deployed networks in In this paper we further discuss the complexity and
applicability aspects in detail in the following sectionOne of the major problems seen in the previously
proposed resource allocation techniques for LoRaWAN
is the missing support for real dynamic environments
which keep on changing with time Furthermore in the
experiments section we show that LoRaDRL can sense
the performance drop due to frequency jamming and
hence can shift the system to the less interfered channels
and hence maintain the performance of the network We
also show the ineffectiveness of the rulebased system
LoRaSim against such attacksA Problem StatementLoRa provides multiple SF values for transmission
which lead to different data rates The signals generated
using different SF values are partially orthogonal to each
other By compromising the data rate the concurrent
transmissions can be increased by the use of different SF
values and transmission channels The efcient selection
of these parameters in dense networks can not only save
energy but also increase the capacity of the networkB System ModeIn our proposed scheme we consider a singlegateway
LoRa network containing k LoRa EDs uniformly dis
tributed over an area of a radius of 4500m with the
gateway present in the center The EDs can choose to
transmit the data using different PHYlayer parameter
combinations over multiple available transmission chan
nels We do not limit the SF values for the EDs and
all the EDs are free to use any of the SF values The
gateway acts as the agent whose goal is to decide the
PHYlayer parameters for each of the EDs It is assumed
that a new ED arrives at each timestep and is located
at an arbitrary location The normalized count of each
of the actions taken until the current step and the
approximate distance of the newcoming LoRa ED is
taken as the state of the environmentThe basic mapping of our algorithm on the workow
of DRL has been given in Fig 2 The agent takes a
specic action choosing a PHYlayer parameters combi
nation for the new LoRa ED at a timestep and receives
a reward based on the achieved packet delivery ratio
PDR and powerusage based on that chosen actionFig 2 Mapping of our problem setup on DRL The gateway is considered the
agent and the LoRa network represents the environmentWe use PDR and energy consumption as our per
formance metrics The PDR is dened as the ratio of
correctly delivered messages to transmitted messages
over a period of time The achievable PDR depends on
the position count and behavior of LoRa EDsFor experimental purposes we are assuming a LoRa
network consisting of class C devices for training After
training our model can be deployed with any class of
the LoRa devices We use the GaussMarkov Modefor the mobility of the EDs This model eliminates the
sudden stops and sharp turns encountered in the Random
Walk Mobility Model by allowing past velocities and
directions to inuence future velocities and directionsOur previous results the signals from the EDs It is to be noted that the EDs
present near buildings will show less received power
than in case of open space This will lead the algorithm
to choose higher SF values for such devices which is a
good choiceThe LoRa devices can support a power level as low as
2 dB In case multiple power level choices are included
in the actionspace the energy consumption can reduce
considerably Due to the high trainingconvergence time
of LoRaDRL we propose the training of LoRaDRL to
be performed in simulation and then the model be de
ployed in real networks with the learning to be continued
with a small learning rate This will help our proposed
model adapt and t itself to the real environmentIt is to be noted that we assume that the number of
EDs and packet arrival rate is known at the gatewayIt takes around 5 packet transmissions for the gateway
to get a reliable estimate of PDR For mobile EDs we
assume that the current PDR is being averaged with the
previous 4 transmissions PDR As we are not assuming
very high velocities hence the time required to get a
good estimate of PDR is acceptableIV PROPOSED SCHEME FOR ADAPTIVE PHYLAYER
PARAMETER SELECTIONA Reward FunctionTo assist in the learning process we have designed a
specialized rewardcost function to optimize PHYlayer
transmission parameters selection for LoRa EDs By
using this reward function the maximum reward is given
to the optimal combination of PHYlayer parametersThe reward function is given in the below equationsEquation 3 is the reward for optimizing the PDR of the
network only Equation 4 is the modied equivalent to
include power optimizationrt    P DRED    airtimeEDrt  P DRED  airtimeED  P owerEDwhereP owerED P owerM ax  P owerChosen
P owerM ax  P owerM inED is the newcoming ED that has arrived in the
previous timestep P DR is the package delivery ratio
and airtimeED is the airtime of the specic ED in
seconds     are the relative constants used to
assign appropriate weights to P DR airtimeED and
P owerED These constants act as hyperparameters and
can be chosen depending on the dynamics of the LoRa
network P ower is the reward based on the power choice
for the ED This part of the reward function is designed
in such a way that if we have 3 available power levels
3 dB 6 dB and 12 dB the reward is also dened in a
distributed fashion In this way more reward say 4x wibe given to the agent if it chooses 3 dB power lesser
reward 3x will be given if it chooses the 6 dB power
and the least reward x will be given if it chooses thedB powerB Proposed AlgorithmThe proposed DDQNbased algorithm for learning
the PHYlayer transmission parameters for EDs in a
LoRa network has been given in Algorithm 1 Qnetwork
structure is taken as input to the model and it returns
a trained DDQN network at the output The algorithm
trains for a given number of episodes where each episode
is run for timesteps equal to the maximum number
of EDs present in the system we assume that a new
ED arrives at each timestep The replay buffer is
populated by the agent by taking different actions at
different states Samples from this replay buffer are then
used to train the neural network This trained network
provides the optimal policy for determining the best
PHYlayer parameters for the EDs based on the state
of the environmentAlgorithm 1 LoRaDRInput QNetwork Structure

transfer the data The transmissions are carried out on
the base of the different transmission classes ie class
A B  C We propose that the LoRa ED send the
packets to the gateway which in return either sends
an acknowledgment to use the previous parameters or
sends the new PHYlayer parameters combination to
be used for carrying out further transmissions through
the control packets using the xed bandwidth channeof 125 kHz In case the LoRa ED does not receive
the parameters or acknowledgment from the gateway
it either chooses the maximum available power and SF
to transmit the signal or uses the last allocated PHYlayer parameters for the transmission This mechanism
has also been shown in Fig 3 Our algorithm also
works well on the reduced action space by allowing the
agent to choose from a specic subset of actions This
reduced subset can be made according to the datarate
requirements of different applications by xing a certain
SF CR or transmission channeFig 3 Proposed mechanism for implementing our proposed algorithm in reaLoRa networksC DRL SpecicationsThe neural network is kept small to make the solution
more practical A discount factor of 07 has been used
to ensure the dependence of the current action on future
rewards Furthermore we also use the cid15greedy learning
procedure to fully explore the statespace where action
at timestep t is given asat cid26 maxaQts aRandom Actionwith probability 1  cidwith probability cidWe have chosen linear activation at the output layer
so that we get a probability for each of the actions In
this way if some of the EDs can choose only a subset
of actions then that ED can choose the action with the
maximum probability from that subset of actions The
target Qnetwork is updated on regular intervals with the
weights of the online networkD Computational ComplexityWe have taken the same statespace as our previous
submission  ie the normalized count of each action
and the approximate distance of the newcoming ED
from the gateway Due to this specialized statespace
the complexity of the problem does not increase with
the increase of the enddevices Also we have chosen
a minimal size for the DNN which requires minimaresources for training In the later sections we have
enhanced our previously proposed scheme to support
dense networks Although the introduction of multiple
channels increases both the action and the state count
the same DNN can learn as the goal of the agent in both
these cases is the same The overall complexity of our
algorithm is ON N O1 where ON N is the complexity
of the neural network which is a constant in our caseE Applicability to Real EnvironmentsWe have kept the size of the neural networks the
smallest possible This makes it applicable to gateways
being backed by lowend computers The activation on
the last layer has been set to linear Due to this our
neural network does not train itself to focus on just one
action but gives probability to each action in the action
space So in case a specic ED is only able to support
a subspace of actions the ED can choose the possible
action with the highest probabilityThe DDQN can see the change in the performance
of the network based on the reward achieved by taking
certain actions in certain states This ability makes the
algorithm adaptive as whenever the DDQN observes a
suboptimal action being performed it adapts the policy
in favor of the better available action This adaptive be
havior is a core benet of RL Our proposed centralized
approach offers many signicant benets including the
ability to adapt a feature missing in previous solutionsand support for EDs mobilityF MultiChannel Extension of LoRaDRIn our previous work our focus was only on a single
channel and singlegateway scheme In this work we
have performed a performance evaluation of the scheme
under new scenarios and extended the scheme to multi
channel LoRa networks Modication of the action space
is involved in order to include multiple channels to
support dense LoRa deployments We have tested the
multichannel scheme in dense LoRa deployments and
shown its ability to manage We have also tested the
performance of LoRaDRL against frequency blocking
and shown its ability to adapt
to the environmentainterferenceV EXPERIMENTS  RESULTSFor analysis and comparison of our algorithm with
the existing stateoftheart techniques   we
perform experiments to evaluate performance under idifferent mobility velocities ii multichannel dense
scenarios iii multiple MAC protocols and iv large
scale frequency jamming attacks These experiments
have been discussed in the following subsections Aof the provided results have just been simulated for
experimental purposes We have made certain design
choices just to make it easier for the reviewer to compare
the performance of our proposed technique with the
other counterpartsIn our experiments we use a data frame size of
50 bytes Typical IoT use cases generate small data
packets hence 50byte frame size can represent a large
number of IoT use cases In our experiments the data
generation model is based on Poisson distribution as
it can model multitude of IoT usecases data trafc

been provided in Table II The specications of the
neural network have been provided in TableA Performance Under Increasing MobilityAs discussed in the introduction sectionthe reanetworks are a combination of mobile and nonmobile
EDs The mobile EDs move with varying velocities
between low and high In this subsection we perform
experiments to show the ability of LoRaDRL to manage
such uniformly distributed heterogeneous networks We
consider a network of 100 EDs and a single frequency
channel available for transmission The EDs have only a
single power level to choose from ie 14 dB Different
velocities of mobile EDs were chosen ie 5  3 kmhr
and 30  10 kmhr The former relates to the health
monitoring devices like smartwatches etc communicat
ing with the gateway while the latter relates to EDs
mounted on bicycles carts etc As we are currently
considering a network consisting of a single gateway
we have not considered velocities greater than 30 kmhrFig 4 shows the performance of LoRaDRL

rulebased algorithm proposed by Bor et al Fig 4 Performance evaluation based on different mobility velocitiesComparison of PDR of LoRa networks under LoRaSim LoRaMAB and
LoRaDRL with a condence interval of 95 It can be seen that mobility
does not affect the performance of LoRaDRL  LoRaSim while the increase in
velocity causes a deterioration in the performance of LoRaMABB Performance In Multichannel ScenariosAs we know the spreading factors from SF7SFare partially orthogonal and transmissions with different
SFs can be received on the same channel concurrentlySimilarly the frequency channels are also orthogonaand the same SF can be received on different channels
without any interchannel collisions Current LoRa gate
ways can receive transmissions from LoRa devices on
8 different channels simultaneously For this purpose
multichannel transceivers are used in the LoRa gatewayDifferent frequencies do not interfere with each other
hence the devices can choose from the available SFs
without compromising on the PDRIn our previous work we had taken the combination of
SF and power as the action of the agent For converting
into a multichannel scheme we add the channel fre
quency to the action space hence increasing the action
count according to the available frequencies For testing
the performance of LoRaDRL in dense deployments we
consider an environment consisting of 1000 LoRa EDs
and a single gateway The available choices of frequency
channels are set to 8 which is the maximum number
of frequency channels a LoRa gateway can receive and
decode simultaneous transmissions The EDs have only
a single power level to choose from ie 14 dBThe nodecount wise PDR of LoRaDRL during learn
ing in dense LoRa networks has been shown in Ta

these networks effectively In the table a very smadrop of PDR can be seen with the increase in the
count of EDs Table Va shows the percentage of SF

the LoRa performance using different MAC protocols
than pure ALOHA By using our proposed algorithm
LoRaDRL we can use the basic ALOHA to perform
similar to complex MAC protocols In this subsection

the performance of our proposed algorithm
LoRaDRL with multiple MAC protocols We consider
a 2channel LoRa network containing 100 uniformly
placed EDs The delay in case of delay before transmit
is calculated using the following equationTD  EDID  Ud mod P ktiatwhere EDID is the ID of the respective ED Ud is
the delay in microseconds and P ktiat is the node mean
packet arrival time For these experiments Ud was set
to 1000 Fig 5 shows the observed performance Only
a minor difference in performance can be seen as all the
features of these MAC protocols are already present in
LoRaDRL Furthermore LoRaDRL reduces the burden
on ordinary nodes by pushing the complexity to a centraentity the gateway The performance of LoRaSim with
different MAC protocols has been shown in Channel sensing multiple access CSMA involves the
sensing of the channel before transmission and transmit
ting if the channel is free else waiting for a certain timeFig 5 Figure showing the performance of LoRaDRL with different MAC
protocols It can be seen that there is a minor performance difference while
using different MAC protocols with LoRaDRL The bars are plotted with 95
condence intervainterval and then sensing the transmission channel againIn this way the EDs have to wait for the channel to
become free which is a rare case in dense networksLoRaDRL enables concurrent data transmissions and
removes the requirement of sensing the channel and
waiting This reduces the power requirement for the EDs
and shifts the complexity from the resourceconstrained
EDs to the gateway Furthermore most of the stateof
theart MAC layer protocols for LoRa are complex while
LoRaDRL is based on ALOHAD Performance Under Adversarial Frequency Jamming
AttacksLargescalefrequency jamming attackscan be
avoided by a continuous shifting of frequencies hence
making the jamming difcult  However in realistic
settings the presence of an intermediary to continuously
change the settings is not necessary This puts forward
the need for intelligent algorithms that can adapt to the
changing environment in the favor of optimal settingsOur technique can adapt to jamming attacks and can re
tain the performance of the LoRa network by frequency
hopping In the case of RL the learning and prediction
go hand in hand which makes it proactive to adversariaattacks and adaptive to the changing conditions For this experiment we assume that there is another
network present in the area who is generating very high
internetwork interference hence reducing the perfor
mance of our LoRa network We consider a network
consisting of 100 LoRa EDs and two frequency channels
available for transmission The EDs have only a single
power level to choose from ie 14 dB The network is
taken to be uniformly distributed with the EDs moving
with random velocities under 1 kmhrFig 6 shows the training of multichannel LoRaDRalgorithm At epoch 900 one frequency out of the twothe gateway We have also tested our proposed technique
under largescale jamming attacks where the rulebased
techniques fail badly The results show the effectiveness
of our proposed technique against such attacks and its
adaptiveness to the changes in the environment

LoRaSim scheme under frequency jamming attack A small drop of performance
is seen in the case of LoRaDRL as it shifts to the other available frequency While
in the case of LoRaSim a sudden drop of performance can be seen because of
the absence of a feedback loopavailable ones is jammed This jamming results in a
sudden drop in performance The system later learns on
the base of the current performance and can adapt to
the changing environment and achieve the performance
of singlechannel LoRaDRL While in the case of a
frequency jamming attack on a rulebased LoRaSim
the performance drops to half The reason for this
is the random selection of a frequency channel for
each transmission The performance of LoRaSim under
frequency jamming attack has been shown in this gure
which shows no retention of performance It is to be
noted here that the collisions and jamming with respect
to the downlink communication is left as future workAll of the provided experiments were performed on
a lowend 4th generation i3 laptop It took on average

sectors It helps businesses get a much deeper understanding of their customers enables monitoring of individuals moods in
healthcare education or the automotive industry and enables identication of violence and threat in forensics to name a fewHowever AER technology also risks using articial intelligence AI to interpret sensitive human emotions It can be used for economic
and political power and against individual rights Human emotions are highly personal and users have justiable concerns about
privacy invasion emotional manipulation and bias In this paper we present the promises and perils of AER applications We discuss
the ethical challenges related to the data and AER systems and highlight the prescriptions for prosocial perspectives for future AER

ticial intelligence AI to algorithmically retrieve a per
sons emotional state using knowledge from psychology
linguistics signal processing and machine learning MDevelopment of AER capabilities can have a transformative
effect on society with wideranging implications due to the
critical role emotions play in human lives ranging from
perception learning and decisionmaking In this paper we use the term AER and focus on human
target AER Humantargeted AER starts with active or pas
sive sensors eg a video camera microphone physiologi
cal sensor that mainly captures contextual and behaviouradata related to affective facial expressions speech signals

the quality of life enable individuals to better understand
and control their affective states eg fear happiness lone
liness anger interest and alertness and mitigate various
psychological issues that could have resulted in incidents
of suicide homicide disease and accident  This can
greatly improve quality of life and help achieve longterm
goals  It can help save many lives by monitoring people
and regulating their emotions through stressful times eg
in pandemics or economic crises It also minimises counter
productive behaviour such as suicidal tendencies and or
antisocial behaviour In healthcare settings AER services
play a pivotal role in shaping the healthcare functionality
and communication among professionals thereby improv
ing professionalpatient relations  It can help design
assessment and monitoring of emotional consequences due
to different illnesses For example AER systems can beTABLESummary of promises of AER technology in different domainsDomainsHealthcareEducationSafetyLaw enforcement

fore amid the ongoing global economic and public health
crisis during the COVID19 pandemic  The pandemic
situation impacts people physically mentally and econom
ically AER systems can help to analyse and understand
emotional responses during such crises affecting mentahealth Studies   22 EducationEmotions are very crucial in the education systems due
to their important role in the cognitive processes respon
sible for assimilating and learning new information Unfortunately the current education system fails to track
students emotions and hidden indicators of their internafeelings thus making it delicate to adapt and keep the
communication channel intact It has been found that the
identication and monitoring of the learners emotionastate greatly facilitates the teacher in taking actions that
signicantly enhance the tutoring quality and execution and
improve studentteacher interactions  Therefore it is
worthwhile to utilise smart systems that can model the
relations between emotions cognition and action in the
learning context  In this regard AER systems can beconsidered by schools to quantify student moods and en
gagement in the classroom  AER could help to reinforce
students attention motivation and selfregulation toward
studies It could also help promote effective learning by
increasing students interest  On the other hand AER
systems can improve certain emotional qualities teachers
must have to facilitate pedagogical approaches in education23 SafetyEmotions are directly linked to human problemsolving
abilities  Safety behaviours can be predicted from the
individuals ability to manage and process emotions during
a time of stress There is ample evidence that negative
emotions such as anger fear and anxiety strongly affect hu
man behaviour and occupational safety  For example
emotions can impact workplace safety and health In the
workplace the negative mood of a person can contaminate
an entire team or group This may damage workplace safety
and impair team performance If such behaviours are left
unaddressed negative emotions can be a workplace hazard
with visible effects on team safety AER systems can provide
better solutions to monitor an individuals mood and emo
tions In addition these systems can help nd workers who
might need helpIn transport AER systems can be utilised to improve the
safety of drivers as well as anyone on the road Driving
occupies a large portion of our daily life and is often
associated with the cognitive load that can trigger emotions
like anger or stress which can badly impact human health
and road safety   Studies  24 Law enforcement and forensicsAER systems are increasingly being used for law enforce
ment and forensics where such systems have many pos
sible applications in identifying threats of violence and
terrorism and detecting lies and fraud  In a forensic
investigation a lie can arise from denial evasion distortion
outright fabrication and concealment by offenders to ap
pear nonaccountable for their exertions  AER systems
can help law enforcement agencies to detect deception or
malingering by identifying reliable emotional clues In this
way AER systems provide additional aid and insights to
lawenforcement agencies while pursuing criminal investi
gations  AER systems can also help detect and differen
tiate between acted and genuine victims 25 Advertising and RetaiIn marketing one of the best ways to sell products is
to engage the customers emotionally Companies employ
vast resources for affective marketing by maximising useengagement with AI They attempt to understand and
appeal to the customers interests and emotions  In
order to gauge a shoppers emotion AER systems use
sensing devices installed in hightrafc locations including
entrances aisles checkouts etc AER systems detect the
emotional responses of individual shoppers which help
retailers in making decisions on crucial factors including
product pricing packaging branding or shelf placementIn this way AER systems help retailers understand how
consumers communicate both verbally and nonverbally
which may help fuel customers buying decisionsEmotions highly impact individuals responses to re
ceiving marketing messages Therefore sending an emo
tionally tailored message to the target audience increases
the customers attention to the advertisement This helps
companies to increase the products appeal and achieve a
higher level of brand recall  Indeed advertisements
with emotional content have more potential to be remem
bered than those conveying notication 26 Emotional and Social IntelligenceEmotional and social intelligence involves understanding
inside oneself observing and interpreting others for cogni
tive and emotional empathy and responding constructively
in a given situation There is great interest in politics to
capture and inuence the mood of the overall popula
tion or community to understand patterns of emotionacontagion  Emotional and social intelligence can help
leaders and decisionmakers pick up emotional cues from a
population and handle highly challenging situations Socianetworks are particularly utilised to understand population
behaviours 27 Monitoring and EvaluationAER systems are being utilised to screen candidates in
interviewsvideo games  AER systems are highly suited to be
utilised for the design of affectaware gaming platforms
that can monitor players emotional states and dynamically
change the games theme to more effectively engage the
player  In these ways affectaware video games with
an entertainment character can also be utilised to initiate
prosocial behaviour by preventing antisocial actions along
with various applications such as elearning marketing
systems and psychological training or therapy3 PERILS OF AERAER technology has a wide range of potentially intrusive
applications as discussed in the previous Section 2 It uses
biometric data that may be used to reveal private informa
tion about individuals physical or mental states feelings
and thoughts It can also be used to interfere with the for
mation of beliefs ideas and opinions Modern AER systems
often use deep learning DL models to obtain stateofthe
art performance However such DL models are known to be
inscrutable and are also not robust and are vulnerable to bias
and poor performance in the face of distribution shifts and
adversarial attacks  This raises concerns about using
the validity of AER services since it is not uncommon to see
that even wellintentioned technologies can have negative
consequences and how technologies can end up harming
rather than benetting people   We discuss some of
the prominent perils of AER next31 Risk of Exploitative ManipulationAER technology can be exploited and used to inuence
and control driving markets politics and violence Al
ready there is a big concern in the community about major
technology companies morphing into empires of behaviour
modication  With AER having access to intimate hu
man emotions the risk of exploitative manipulation rises
further as such information can be used to interfere with
the formation of beliefs ideas opinions and identity by
inuencing emotions or feelings 32 Lack of Consent and Privacy ViolationsAER systems utilise AI technology in their design with
biometrics or other kinds of personal data speech faciaimage among others This allows for information about
physical or mental health thoughts or feelingswhich an
individual may not want to choose to shareto be automat
ically inferred without the persons consent or knowledgeThis has grave privacy concerns and can be used to establish
and strengthen oppressive dystopian societies28 GamingVideo games are related to the burgeoning area of enter
tainment applications Millions of users across the globe
are entertained by violent games  and most selling
games contain violence and aggression These video games
are played by adolescents  For instance in the United
States 81 of adolescents have access to digital games and
on average a gamer spends 6 to 8 hours a week playing33 Lack of ExplainabilityAccountabilityAER systems usually lack explainability due to the complex
internal mechanics of the AI model and the widescale
adoption of BlackBox models based on deep learning
technology This inability to understand how AI performs
in AER systems hinders its deployment in law healthcare
and enterprises from handling sensitive consumer dataUnderstanding how AER data is handled and how AI has
reached a particular decision is even more critical for datprotection regulation Explainability of AER services wiallow companies to track AI decisions and monitor biased
actions This will also ensure that AER processes align with
regulation and that decisionmaking is more systematic and
accountable34 Vulnerability to Adversarial AttacksModern AERbased tools typically rely on deep learning
based models such as those built on deep neural networks
DNNs which are composed of multiple hidden layersDNNs are also quite fragile to very small speciallycrafted
adversarial perturbations to their inputs This can cause
false prediction in AER systems  which might have
adverse consequences For instance an adversarially crafted
example can cause an AER system to diagnose mentadiseases inaccurately This is one of the critical concerns of
integrating AIbased services like AER in reallife35 Vulnerability to BiasThere is scepticism in the community regarding the efcacy
of AER and fears that using AER may accentuate and
institutionalise bias  Since getting accurately labelled
data is very expensive and timeconsuming any embedded
bias in large annotated emotional training data is likely to
be built into any systems developed using such data Most
of the AER systems use laboratorydesigned datasets based
on actors simulating emotional states in front of a cameraFurthermore the labels used by ML models typically rep
resent perceived emotion rather than felt emotion since the
majority of the existing AER datasets are labelled by human
annotators based on their perception  For instance
in facial emotion recognition the labels for a photograph
are provided by annotators not by the individual in the
photographs  This might not represent genuine inner
emotions and may contain hidden biases that may become
apparent only after deployment36 Reductionist Emotional ModelsAER algorithms base their working on basic emotion theo
ries 37 AIs White Guy Problem or NeoColonialismSome ndings indicate that AI technology suffers from
problems such as sexism racism and other forms of dis
crimination  A major aspect related to this arises from
homogeneous or unrepresentative data Another reasoncould be focusing on the majority class since optimising
for the majority class will usually improve overall accuracyUnfortunately this translates into discrimination against
the minority classes as AI models typically do not auto
matically provide fairness unless constraints are placed for
ensuring fairness in which case the overall accuracy wiusually reduce as fairness and accuracy are different objec
tives and it is not uncommon for them to have tradeoffs If we do not work to make AI more inclusive we
risk creating machine intelligence that mirrors a narrow
and privileged vision of society with its old familiar bi
ases and stereotypes Kate Crawford New York Times
 Experts are now calling
out for using decolonial theory as a tool for sociotechnicaforesight in AI to ensure that the hegemony resulting from
the domination of the AI industry by a limited number of
demographic groups and nations does not have harmfeffects globally 4 ETHICAL CONCERNS WITH AERGiving emotions to a computer is another term for AER
technology  It is exciting and a pipe dream to have a
humanlike or superior emotion detection system In the last
decade techniques based on advanced techniques in Mand deep learning have outperformed almost all classicamethods in recognising and understanding human emo
tions from facial speech and text inputs These advanced
learning techniques have produced effective and efcient
results in AER and automated the whole process AER
systems are used in the commercial market for understand
ing user engagement sentiment analysis attention tracking
behaviour understanding etc However these AER systems
are also prone to shortcomings and biases in the training
and testing data The literature on the shortcomings of
traditional and deep ML techniques suggests that data and
algorithmic biases can impact the performance of these
learning techniques  AER systems are developed using
data acquired from humans and human biases are likely
to be translated into the learning process impairing AER
system judgements  There is a need to enforce respon
sible AI practices  and ethical guidelines for the design
development and integration of AER systems in the wild
The use of AER for emotional surveillance raises many
ethical concerns which motivates the need to identify basic
ethical principles and guidelines that address ethical issues
arising from the use of AER technology on human subjects
to ensure that human subjects are not exploited or manipu
lated In this regard we can look at a traditional consensus
on basic principles such as those expressed in the Belmont
Report produced in 1979 by the US National Commission
for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and
Behavioural Research  The
Belmont Report identied three main principles1 respect
for persons 2 benecence and 3 justicein their study
focused on documenting the basic ethical principles and
guidelines that should direct the conduct of biomedical and
behavioural research involving human subjects In light of
the described perils of uncritical use of technology and the
various ethical and moral dilemmas posed by AI  aFig 2 Summary of ethical concerns associated with AERlot of attention has focused on incorporating ethics in the
eld of AI leading to a proliferation of AI ethics principles
and code of ethics Interestingly Jobin et al 41 Ethical Concerns Related to JusticeAI is being used in every facet of daily life including
criminal justice social media social justice health care
smart cities and urban computing Although it has been
well stated in the literature that AIbased systems are in
capable of understanding the concepts of justice and so
cial standards  Buolamwini et al In the last few years AIbased predictive policing tools
are becoming a part of global criminal justice systems These
systems are largely based on facial recognition technology
with added emotion recognition and DNA matching These
provides a comprehensive discussion on the ethical issues of
predictive policing and facial recognition systems in crimi
nal justice systems They argued that these systems violate
privacy rights autonomy rights and basic human moralityThey also discuss the misuse of AIbased predictive policing
and facialemotion recognition tools in liberal democra
cies and the dangers of similar technology in authoritarian
states In order to use With AIbased systems making criticajudgements about individuals hiring process advertising
process etc it is vital to consider and address ethicaconcerns Automated physiognomy refers to the use of Amodels to identify a persons gender emotional state leveof intellect and other characteristics from only one photo
graph of them Engelmann et al Podoletz authority raise privacy concerns and operate as an op
pressive instrument in authoritarian states Podoletz goes
on to claim that deploying emotional AI tools like AER
would result in a highly regulated and controlled society
causing a severe schism in the social justice system Lastly
The AER sector is predicted to be worth 26 billion by
2026  Crawford et al As previously described it has been observed in the
literature that AI models do not automatically provide
fairness or justice unless it is explicitly asked for  As
Stuart Russell describes in his book a problem underlying
the model of conventional optimisationbased AI is that
you only get what you explicitly ask for with the unstated
assumption being that you implicitly agree that you do not
care at all about everything you do not specify  The1  calls this the King Midas problem of AI referring to
the Greek mythological story in which King Midas gets athat he species but the situation still ends unacceptably
since he did not specify exactly what he did not want
and unacceptable values were incorrectly inferred Various studies have shown that AER technology is prone
to bias and can suffer from a lack of fairness accountability
and transparency This has real consequences when such
technology is used for critical decisions such as in judi
cial systems for making judgements about sentencing 
 Therefore AER technology requires a continued and
concerted effort to address such issues because misreading
an individuals emotions can cause severe consequences in
specic scenarios42 Ethical Concerns Related to Benecence Non
malecenceEthical principles of benecence do only good and non
malecence do no harm are closely related Benecence
encourages the creation of AI services to promote the well
being of humanity and the planet while nonmalecence
concerns the negative consequences of AI  These con
cerns are also important in the designing and deployment
of AER technology Therefore AER services should avoid
causing both foreseeable and unintentional harm This re
quires a complete understanding of AER technology and
its scientic limitations to manage the attendant risks The
services should be designed to benet human beings and
increase their wellbeing to make AER prosociaDesigning a Prosocial AER system requires mitigation
of ethical concerns highlighted in the literature  With
the unprecedented penetration of social media applications
and the use of surveillance technologies the optin and opt
out model of data sharing is long gone Now most of the
applications gather data irrespective of permissions and the
written conditions that one agrees to upon usage are written
in a language that is a challenge for the regular user It is
problematic and many incidents of unethical use of the data
are being reported in the literature Unfortunately the idea
of benecence  nonmalecence is not considered as vitaas it should have been in designing AER systemsBenecence  nonmalecence principles are based on
moral conscientiousness social good and trustworthiness
of people companies and algorithms Raquib et al et al 43 Ethical Concerns Related to PrivacyAER services mostly use DL algorithms that are trained
on masses of data to learn and perform decisionmakingEthical concerns related to privacy require protecting in
dividuals data and preserving their privacy Over the last
two decades the rise of surveillance capitalism went largely
unchallenged Tech companies like Google and Facebook
provide free online services and use personal data for
mass surveillance over the internet Such companies collect
and scrutinise users online behaviours including searches
purchases likes dislikes and more to predict modify and
control users behaviours Lanier has coined the term BUM
MER2 or Behaviours of Users Modied and Made into an
Empire for Rent for the economic model followed by big
tech corporations in the world of surveillance capitalismThe design of AER systems depends heavily on face
recognition technologies and it is advised in the literature
that emotion recognition systems should be regularly up
dated and audited  Bowyer 2  discussion of privacy and the right to privacy
has become prevalent with the advent and adoption of
new technological applications such as internetofthings
IoT robotics pervasive technologies biometric technolo
gies augmented and virtual reality and digital platforms
 AER systems are used in homes health care facilities
childcare centres social media apps and other digital plat
forms for monitoring data collecting emotion inference
and feedback translation Because the data collected by
AER systems is the property of the device manufacturers
these spaces are becoming more open and prone to privacy
violation  Though there are a few traditional privacy
limitations in place it is challenging to ensure privacy when
AIdriven inference is involved without suitable monitoring
and regulatory mechanisms Camerabased assistive aids
are quickly becoming popular among the sight impairedAIbased vision technologies and in certain situations AER
systems are actively used in these assistive technologiesAkter et al In the last few years ethical concerns related to pri
vacy have become a promising area of research thanks to
the active integration of AIenabled applications such as
camerabased surveillance systems AER systems and oth
ers Ribaric et al Privacy is not just about hiding information it is about
the agency the agency to optin or optout Unfortunately
the concept of agency is frequently overlooked in the design
thinking component of AER systems resulting in biased
and untrustworthy AER systems Because AER systems
predictinfer a persons or a social groups emotions theagency to convey the emotional data through any input
methods such as voice video picture and language should
be with the individual or the social group Woensel et aFig 3 Seven rules for introducing privacy by design in systems 44 Ethical Concerns Related to AutonomyWhen we adopt AER services in daily life we willingly cede
some of our decisionmaking power to AI This may un
dermine the ourishing of human autonomy with articiaautonomy Therefore it is crucial to balance the decision
making power delegated to AER agents and that we retain
for ourselves AER systems must not impair the freedom of
their users so they can live according to their standards and
normsFor AI to yield any benets for the human race it
must be focused on the autonomy of humans rather than
the popular belief of giving more autonomy to machines
 This argument stems from the classical discussions
on whether AI techniques are tools to help improve life by
making tasks easier or AI understanding the problems by
itself and xing them without categorically consenting the
humans Here it is essential to understand what autonomy
means Autonomy is described as the sense of willingness
and a cognitive process of committing to a course of actionCalvo et aof society it is paramount to prefer humans in the loop or
humans on the loopbased algorithms for decision makingIt will ensure that human autonomy and ethical practices
are followed in making critical decisionsEmotion recognition systems are trained on the data
harvested from social media and digital platforms to un
derstand and infer emotions Andalibi et al 5 PATH TO A PROSOCIAL FUTURE FOR AER
As motivated in the previous sections AER systems are
promising for contributing to social good in a wide variety
of applications such as healthcare education safety and law
enforcement but at the same time it is beset with severarisks and perils which must be addressed Qadir et a51 Better Awareness and EducationThe development of AER software is bringing enormous
changes to society through data analysis AER Technology
has the positive effect of revolutionising many areas by
solving various existing problems On the other hand AER
technologies are twosided which can also cause problemsTherefore it is crucial to raise awareness among the broader
population about AERs role in our lives and the use and
purchase of AER services This can help to achieve large
scale adoption of AER services among the general popula
tion and minimise the risk of being negatively proled by
AER technology52 Auditable AERThe auditability of AI describes the possibility of evaluating
models algorithms and datasets in terms of operation
results and effects It has two parts including technicaand ethical The technical part assesses the reliability and
accuracy of results however the ethical part apprehends its
individual and collective impacts and checks the risks of
breaching certain principles including equality or privacyAER systems learn from the data they are exposed to and
make decisions using ML algorithms They can develop
or even amplify biases and discrimination Therefore it is
essential to audit and test AER algorithms throughout their
life cycle to pinpoint the origin of errors and detect risks to
avoid their impact on the lives of individuals and societyIt will help to systematically probe AER systems uncover
biases and avoid undesirable behaviour53 Explainable and Interpretable AERA key reason behind the fragility of AER services is the
blackbox nature of ML models used for the decision
making process These ML models are neither explainable
nor their outcomes interpretable To realise the real potentiaof AER systems it is highly desirable to make them ex
plainable in a humanunderstandable way In recent years
signicant research has been devoted to developing novemethods for explaining and interpreting ML models In the
literature different explainable approaches can be broadly
classied as whitebox and blackbox explanation methodsThe whitebox explanation method describes the model by
identifying the most critical features that contributed to a
specic prediction  Another method for whitebox ex
planation is to compute the predictions gradient concerning
individual input samples to discover the predictions rele
vant features Whitebox explanation mainly provides the
modelspecic explanation while the blackbox technique
provides local explanations of a model for a prediction Explaining ML models and their decision is critical as it
is the key enabling factor for building trust and ensuring
fairness in decision making This is also important for AER
applications where decisions directly impact human life54 Privacy Preserving AERIn AER services the privacy of the users data is a growing
concern mainly when AER is performed on cloud plat
forms AER companies gather a large amount of user data
to perform emotion analysis The data gathered by these
companies is kept forever and the user does mostly not
have any or little control over it The images video and
voice samples but also textual bits also contain sensitive
background information such as faces gender language
etc The leakage of this data can be used maliciously without
the users consent by an eavesdropping adversary and may
cause threatening consequences to peoples lives Therefore
it is crucial to utilise privacypreserving AI models in AER
systems to protect users privacy The methods and tech
niques for developing AI systems that ensure privacy falls
under the umbrella of privacypreserving APrivacypreserving AI has four major pillars1 Training data privacy which can be ensured by
Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent
DPSGD and PATE3 Output privacy which can be ensured by using
Homomorphic Encryption Secure Multiparty Com
putation MPC and Federated Learning4 Model privacy which can be ensured by applyingdifferential privacy on the output of an AI mode55 Ethical Framework for AERIn recent times there has been much work on developing
ethical principles and frameworks for AI  A report on
the ethics of AI and the applications of automated emotionaintelligence and its risk is presented in  There is a
need for similar efforts focused on developing an ethicaframework for AIbased AER which can enable various

written consent from an individual before using the
individuals data in a manner that was not men

consent to use an AER system for one purpose an
entity must seek consent from that individual for us
ing AER technology for another purpose However
users should be free to withdraw their consent atany time An entity must not use the AER system
to determine an individuals colour race religion

shared or sold without the informed written consent

wide range of applications including healthcare crime

great potential however recent studies are focused on
speechemotion recognition using complex architecturesIn this paper a nonspeechbased emotion recognition
system is proposed which can rely on edge comput
ing to analyse emotions conveyed through nonspeech
expressions like screaming and crying In particular
we explore knowledge distillation to design a computa

devices with limited resources without degrading the
performance signicantly We comprehensively evaluate
our proposed framework using two publicly available
datasets and highlight its effectiveness by comparing
the results with the wellknown MobileNet model Our
results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of
using edge computing for nonspeech emotion detection
which can potentially improve applications that rely on

and the race among tech manufacturers to capture
the market share has reached a point where the
communication systems are struggling to full the
quality of service and experience requirements The
merging of Articial Intelligence AI with the IoT
has resulted in a plethora of practical applications
in recent years These applications span a wide
range of elds from image classication to stable
diffusion Email siddiquelatifquteduathis combination Additionally voice assistants and
adaptive emotion recognition Edge computing is a distributed computing
paradigm that decreases the data transmission load
to the cloud by bringing enterprise applications
near the data sources such as IoT devices or edge
servers This proximity to data at its sources has the
potential to bring strong business benets including
better response times improved bandwidth availabil
ity faster decisionmaking and privacy preservationThe development of computational technologies like
graphics processing units tensor processing units etc
makes it feasible to ofoad some computational tasks
to potent edge servers When it comes to realtime ser
vicesapplications eg trafc monitoring systems fa
cial recognition control system applications latency
quality of service and experience become increasingly
critical In particular low latency is crucial in emotion
recognition applications where the computing device
needs to classify the users emotional state from given
input audio or visual data for a particular applicationRealtime emotion identication becomes even more
important in a lifethreatening serious situation In
such cases edge computing has the potential to meet
the latency requirements In this work we present an
edge computingbased nonspeech emotion detection
systemEmotion recognition systems gained traction and
their performance has increased dramatically owing
to cuttingedge DLenabled face voice language and
psychological signal models The majority of emotion
sensing services use a system paradigm in which raw
data collected via IoT sensors is transferred to a distant
server for processing and decisionmaking as showny




aFig 1 Stateoftheart nonspeech emotionsensing system that transmits raw speech signals over the
communication network for emotion analysisin Figure 1 Since emotion recognition systems are
intended to detect and classify emotion in realtime
it is critical to create a system with an acceptable
level of endtoend latency from data acquisition to
emotion classicationExisting studies on speechbased emotion detection
mainly focus on improving the accuracy of the
systems for enabling their realtime applications In these systems they use audio conversations and
pass them to different deeplearning models to predict
different emotions  The audio conversations used
in these systems contain scripted speech datasetsHowever emotions do not always exist in speechNonspeech signals like screams also contain rich
emotions The timely identication of screams has a
wide range of applications in public spaces healthcare
 age care rescue services crime control and
gaming The delays in classication might result
in a fatality and the latency issue becomes even
more concerning In addition stateoftheart emotion
sensing applications follow the system model in which
raw speech is transmitted to the remote server for
processing and decisionmaking Such systems are
successful in reallife however they involve complete
sharing of speech over the communication network
which may lead to adverse consequences to peoples
privacy   Edge computing addresses the
latency concerns and privacy related concerns by
processing data at the edge server in a federated
environment Most of the emotionsensing services follow the
system model in which raw speech is transmitted to
the remote server for processing and decisionmakingThis has been shown in Figure 1 Such systems
are successful in reallife however they involve
complete sharing of speech over the communication
network which may lead to adverse consequences to
peoples privacy   Speech signal contains
sensitive information about the message speaker

In this section we will provide a brief description
of the available scream detection systems from the
literature The objective here is to provide a non
exhaustive list of works based on nonspeech emotion
recognitionbased systemsA Healthcare and Rescue ServicesUnderstanding nonverbal emotions is a growing
area of investigation in healthcare research In the
recent pandemic many researchers investigated the
prospect of producing an early forecast of COVID
19 by understanding the sound of coughs Similarly
many elderly patients care researchers sought to
comprehend the patients requirements by detecting
and interpreting coughs and screams  Psychologists are also seeking to detect and com
prehend nonverbal emotional activity to identify
various psychiatric disorders We have also seen
remarkable growth in assistive technology for the
sick and the elderly in recent years Several of
them were in the form of wristhand bands and
lightweight sensors placed on and within the human
body These assistive technologies discern nonspeech
based human emotions and other human capabilities
by combining cuttingedge IoT technology with
broadranging learning algorithms Alam et al Another application of nonverbal speech detection
which is partly related to healthcare is rescue servicesScream detection techniques play a vital role in locat
ing the victim human or animal in catastrophes such
as earthquakes wildres etc Since rescuerelated
operations are time sensitive and require vigilance
using AIML techniques for scream detection can aid
in the rescue of the trapped victims under debris and
in the burning sites Saeed et al B Crime ControWith the advent of AI and advanced communi
cation technologies crime detection is becoming a
booming research direction Scream detection has a
direct relation with violent crimes and using AIMtechniques aided by the data gathered from multiple
sensors deployed across urban spaces is an interesting
application Laftte et al  C Home ApplicationsScream detection is becoming an essential tooaccompanying visual monitoring in homes security

systems Conventional speech dialogue datasets do not
contain enough screams for learning and investigating
the screams properly Mori et al III PROPOSED SYSTEMIn this section we discuss the details of the
proposed edgebased nonspeech emotion recognition
system The proposed framework in this study Figure
2 offers data collection and analytics support within
the 5G network architecture which is commonly
referred to as the network data analytics framework
NWDA according to 3GPP standards Basically the
proposed framework can invoke NWDA functions
to provide these two core functionalities rst data
collection from network functions NFs ie locadata processing and second data analytics and non
speech emotion recognition Specically the proposed
framework serves the following key layers including
sensing edge computing and decisionmaking layersA NonSpeech signal Sensing LayerIn order to perform edgebased nonspeech emotion
recognition we devised a specialised speech sensing
layer The nonSpeech signalsensing layer enables
enduser devices to collect nonspeech data from
cyberphysical space Nowadays we witness a vast
proliferation of smart edge devices ranging fromFig 2 Components of the proposed system 1 a nonspeech signal sensing layer that collects speech data
from mobile phones personal assistants or smartwatches and converts it into speech features 2 an edge
computing layer that uses these features to train a deep learning model for nonspeech emotion recognition
and 3 a decisionmaking layer that analyses nonspeech emotions and makes decisions based on their
positivity or negativity potentially sending alerts to an ambulance or policesmartphones smartwatches and personal assistants
such as Alexa Home Google Assistant Siri etcThese edge devices specically the personal voice
assistants take speech input and perform certain
actions such as turning on lights shutting down
appliances or playing demanded music In most of
these applications the input speech is converted into
text that helps to determine the users intent using
natural language processing and the specic action
that needs to be taken In our proposed framework
the nonSpeech signal sensing layer inputs raw speech
signals and essential preprocessing is performed
to mitigate the background noise effects The layer
processes the input signal and converts it into the
features ie melspectrograms As shown in Fig 2 in
the nonSpeech signal sensing layer the audio features
are propagated to the network instead of transmitting
raw signals directly to the cloud serverB Edge Computing LayerIn our proposed model the system has edge and
core layers The edge layer consists of end devices
ie mobile phones tablets etc and the edge server
which is placed near the base station BS as mobile
edge computing MEC server  It is assumed
that the MEC server can process edge signals and is
also able to perform analytics on nonspeech emotion
data  It is also assumed that the edge server
has enough computational resources to execute data
intensive machinelearning tasks The proposed frame
work adopts the 3rd generation partnership project3GPP release 16 support for machine learningbased
datadriven optimization The edge server is an important component of
our proposed architecture The edge server leverages
lowconsumption computational and storage hardware
such ie edge cloudlets Deploying deep learning models on edge computing
devices is an active area of research and many
techniques have been proposed to improve the latency
and performance of these models Some prominent
techniques include pruning quantization knowledge
distillation and training computationally efcient
models In our experiments we use knowledge
distillation 1 Knowledge Distillation The process of knowl
edge distillation as the name suggests is the method of
transferring knowledge from a larger computationally
expensive model to a relatively smaller model The
larger and smaller models are called the teacher
and student models respectively Thus knowledge
distillation consists of three principal componentsknowledge 2 distillation algorithm and 3 teacher
student architecture While there are now multiple
methods of distillation algorithms we selected thresponsebased algorithm As shown in Figure 3 the
hypothesis is that the student model will learn to
mimic the predictions of the teacher model This
can be achieved by using a loss function termed the
distillation loss that captures the difference between
the logits of the student and the teacher moderespectivelyFig 3 Responsebased knowledge distillation The
output logits from the student and teacher model are
used to calculate the distillation loss between the
student and teacherAs this loss minimizes overtraining the student
model will improve at making the same predictions
as the teacher In the ofine training scheme the
teacher model is rst trained and the weights are then
frozen Next we train the student model using the
distillation loss and the logits from the teacher modeas targets Following is the equation of the distillation
losscidLd  T 2  KsoftmaxT 1  f T xsoftmaxT 1  gT xcidwhereLd the loss function for knowledge distillation
 a hyperparameter that controls the tradeoff
between the classication loss and the distillation

T  the temperature hyperparameter used to soften the
logits outputs of the last layer before softmax of
the teacher and student models
KL the KullbackLeibler divergence a measure of
how different two probability distributions are
softmax a function that converts the logits to

f T x the logits of the teacher model for input x
gT x the logits of the student model for input x2 Teacher Model Generally for the teacher
model a larger and deeper network is chosen so
that it performs well on the task at hand We chose
ResNetFig 4 Residual layer The weights of the input are
added to the outputs from proceeding convolution
layersFig 5 Resnet18Teacher architecture The coloured

the convolution layers and the
respective kernel sizes output lters and the reduction
of input size The lines between the convolution layers
represent residual connections whereas the dashed
represents that the input of the residual goes through
a convolution for dimension consistency The naFC layer is a dense layer3 Student Model Unlike the teacher model the
student model is smaller and shallower making it
more computationally efcient Our proposed student
network simply consists of 3 convolutional layers
followed by 3 fully connected layers Figureprovides details on the relatively shallower student
model The rst convolution layer has a kernel size
of 7  7 and the remaining two have 5  5 each The
number of lters in each layer is 6 16 and 32 and
after each convolution layer we apply a maxpool layer
of 22 window size The fully connected layers have
the outputs in this order 128 64 2 For regularisatiowe add a dropout after each convolution and fully
connected layer with a dropout probability of 10The nonlinear activation chosen between the layers
is Rectied Linear Unit or commonly referred to as
ReFig 6 Student model Each coloured block is a
convolution layer where K denotes the kernel size
and F denotes the number of output lters The naFC layers are dense layersC Decision Making LayerWe train our scream detection model at edge
devices Edge device communicates with the cloud
server via cellular infrastructure and shares modeoutcome The cloud server is responsible for scream
analytics decisionmaking and storage services We
deploy the proposed classier to the edge devices
to perform the identication tasks The output from
the model is sent to the decisionmaking layer that
can take necessary action based on the situation For
instance if scream emotions are classied as negative
emotions ie the person is in pain or sorrow the cloud
system will send an alert to the healthcare centre or to
the police because the person can be injured or hurt
by someone If the scream emotions are classied as
positive emotions such as joyous screams the cloud
system would not be sending any alertsIV EXPERIMENTAL SETUPIn this section we preset the details on datasetsinput features and training protocoA Datasets Used in Our Experiments ASVPESD The Audio Speech and Vision Pro
cessing Lab Emotional Sound database ASVP
ESD is a dataset that contains speech and non
speech utterances There are a total ofaudio samples that are collected from various
sources The samples include both male and
female speakers and the emotions are boredom

disappointment VIVAE The Variably Intense Vocalizations of

performance of the proposed framework in noisy
conditions The Diverse Environments Multi
channel Acoustic Noise Database DEMANDdataset B Input FeaturesIn speech and audio research melspectrograms
are a popular method to represent input signal Similarly we chose to represent our audio samples as
melspectrograms using a shorttime Fourier Transform
of size 1024 a hop size of 256 and a window size
of 1024 The frequency range was chosen between
08kHz and a total of 128 bands were computedEach melspectrogram was normalized in the range
of 1 1 Since the sample utterances were not
consistent in length we decided on a cutoff ofseconds for larger audios and padded the smaller
ones with zeros giving us consistent 3second audiosBefore converting the audios to melspectrograms of
higher sampling rates we resample them to 16kHzThis sampling rate is kept consistent throughout the
experiments and datasetsC Training ProtocoThe training of the classication tasks was done
using an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 24GB GPwith PyTorch as the framework of choice The modewas trained on a batch size of 64 using the binary
cross entropy loss as the criterion The weights of
each layer were randomly initialized with Adam as
the optimizer with the following parameters 1 
09 2  09999 cid15  1e8 We experimented with
multiple learning rates and found that a learning rate
of 1e5 gave better results with less training timeAll experiments were conducted on 80 and 20
random splits for training and testing respectively For
our scream detection task conducted on the ASVP
ESD dataset we had to balance the scream and non
scream utterances as scream utterances totalledsamples To balance the dataset we randomly selected
1170 nonscream utterances giving us effectively
2340 samples to train the scream detectorDuring experimentation we noticed that the modewould overt resulting in a high train and low test
accuracy This high bias could be attributed to smadataset sizes and to mitigate this problem of high
bias we added augmentations to our training dataThese augmentations were composed of stretching
and contracting audio samples and adding a low
amplitude Gaussian noise Additionally we randomly
masked the time and frequency axes of the computed
melspectrograms This augmentation scheme proved
helpful in terms of model generalisability and traininTABLE I Classication results for experiments with

Scream Type ClassicationAccuracyV RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSThe objective of this proposed system is to detect
nonspeech emotions in the communication network
using edge computing We primarily focus on two
types of experiments scream detection and scream
emotion detection The former separates scream utter
ances from nonscream ones and the latter classies
whether a persons scream is in a situation of danger
or duress This is motivated by the fact that not

all screams warrant an investigation or point
emergency situations It is thus important to cluster
screams in positive and negative categories so that the
user can be notied of the type of scream detected
by the system For each of our experiments we
provide a comparison between the teacher student
and a MobileNetV3small model  a popular
choice for edge computing For brevity we refer to
MobileNetV3small simply as MobileNetV3s in the
proceeding sectionsA NonSpeech Emotion DetectionIn this section we present the results of our scream
detection and scream type classication tasks The
former was conducted on the ASVPESD dataset and
the latter on the VIVAE dataset The results of the
experiments are presented in Table I We can observe
that the model performs well in classifying scream and
nonscream samples However the model struggles
to cluster the utterances into positive and negative
categoriesWe can see how the samples might be clustered by
using the tSNE algorithm B Evaluations in Noisy ConditionsIn realworld scenarios the background is often
not static in nature which causes the inclusion of
noise in the environment To simulate a realworld
scenario we added noise from the DEMAND dataset
to our audio samples and tested our evaluations in a
simulated noisy realworld environment The noisesamples were randomly selected from the following
environments bus metro cafe kitchen and ofceWithin each noise sample we randomly select a chunk
equal to the input audio sample Table II summarises
the results of this experiment To test the robustness
of the model performance we added noise only in the
test split The results show that the model generalises
well when the noise is added for evaluation onlyTABLE II Classication results for experiments in a

MetroC Computational ComplexityThe benchmarks presented in this section are
conducted on an UpBoard shown in Figure 8 having
an IntelR Atom E3940 CPU operating at 160GHz
with an onboard memory of 4GBs The tests are
recorded on the standard Ubuntu 2004 LTS operating
system we did not use the serverheadless versionand PyTorch version 113 The results are concluded
without the use of postprocessing features offered by
PyTorch These features claim to lower the inference
time but generally with some tradeoffsThe total time to load the model and the time
it takes for a single forward pass of an utterance
are two metrics that are of primary concern when it
comes to deploying models in production Likewise
we benchmark these metrics for the teacher student
and MobileNetV3s models Figure 9 provides a
graphical comparison between the benchmarks of
the mentioned models which shows that in terms
of latency the student model is almost twice as fast
as the teacher model and is about 20ms faster than
the MobileNetV3s model Furthermore there is a
signicant difference in terms of load times where
the student model takes the least time to load into
the memory The difference between these metrics
might better be explained by the total parameters
and the size of each model presented in Table IVFig 7 tSNE plots on raw melspectrograms and the penultimate activations embeddings of the teacher and
student model There is no clustering on raw melspectrogreams however the tSNE plots after using the
trained models show samples getting clusteredFig 8 Labelled diagram of UpBoard with IntelRAtom E3940 CPU Source A larger number of parameters in a model increases
the computational cost Similarly a large memory
footprint contributes to higher model loading timesThese results highlight the deployment of the pro
posed system into memory and computation constraint

nonspeech emotion identication system for edge
computing We covered various applications of non
speech emotion identication and provided a case
study based on reallife scenarios We evaluated
system performance based on two publicly available

guish scream sound from other utterances and classify
nonspeech utterances based on their emotional statesTo highlight the robustness of the proposed system
we also evaluated these experiments by adding typicarealworld background noises to our inputs to mimic

human biases to situational biases   These annotation
techniques also necessitate a big pool of human annotators
clear and straightforward annotator instructions and a veri
fication rationale that is not always available or dependable
 Although there are a few unsupervised techniques for
data annotations these techniques necessitate a high sample
size of the data unfortunately the generated annotations do
not embed the context Annotating speech emotion data is a doubly challenging
process The annotators listen to a speech recording and assign
an annotation to a data sample using the predefined criteriaHuman emotions are highly contextdependent and annotating
emotions based on a brief recording in a specific controlled
situation might restrict the annotations accuracy Though the
stateoftheart on humanannotated emotion classification is
strong the generalisability of the learning for unseen data
with slightly different circumstances might stymie the SER
systems effectiveness The recent availability of several LLMs
ChatGPT Google Bard etc has unearthed the possibility
of replacing or assisting human annotators LLMs are trained
on enormous text corpora allowing them to learn and grasp
complicated language patterns Their emergence property In this paper we present an evaluation of the effectivenessof large language models LLMs in annotating speech data
for SER We performed a series of experiments to show
the effectiveness of ChatGPT for data annotation However
we observed that annotations solely based on text

generalisation to speech emotion data due to the absence
of audio context To address this limitation we propose a
novel pipeline that incorporates audio features such as average
energy pitch and gender information to provide essentiaaudio context for accurate sample annotation Furthermore
we introduce a method for encoding speech into a fixed
length discrete feature representation using a Vector Quantised
Variational Autoencoder VQVAE  which serves as the
audio context in the annotation prompt To the best of our
knowledge this is the first endeavour to leverage LLMs for
annotating speech emotion data specifically for classification
purposes and evaluating their performance We conduct a
comparative analysis between LLMbased data annotations
and human data annotations using publicly available datasets
including IEMOCAP and MSPIMPROVIn the following section we provide a brief literature review
on the use of LLMs for data annotation We highlight the
gap between conventional annotations and annotations made
with LLMs Section III covers the methodology used in this
study Section IV presents the initial results and compares
the performance of various LLMs for speech emotion data
annotation Section V provides a detailed discussion of the
results and limitations and Section VI concludes the paper
with the potential to extend this workII RELATED WORKThis section provides an overview of the research on lever
aging fundamental models such as LLMs for data annotation
 Data annotations are critical for developing ML models
capable of uncovering complex patterns in large datasets and
pushing the stateoftheart in a particular domain Human ex
pert annotators bulk annotations semisupervised annotations
and crowdsourced annotations are all widely used approaches
in practice  These strategies have their pros and consHuman annotators for example can provide highquality data
annotations but are susceptible to challenges such as fairness
bias subjectivity high cost and time label drifting annotation
fatigue and inconsistency dealing with data ambiguity and
scalability Bulk annotations are a faster and less expensive
technique to create data annotations but they might result in
lowerquality annotations Semisupervised annotations com
bine the benefits of humanexpert annotations with bulk anno
tations for data annotation but they are complex to implement
and have generalisability and robustness difficulties Although
crowdsourcing human intelligence to annotate large datasets
is the quickest and most costeffective option it can create
lowerquality annotations and is more challenging to manage
the quality of the annotationsRecently a few studies have investigated the efficacy of
LLMs i e ChatGPT for data annotations The goal of these
experiments was to explore the potential of ChatGPT for data
annotation and to find out whether ChatGPT can achieve femergence in downstream tasks such as classification Zhet al Factchecking is a wellknown way to deal with the misin
formation epidemic in computational social science Hose et
al Amin et al ing an unweighted average recall of nearly 910 RoBERTa
outperformed ChatGPT on this task achieving an unweighted
average recall of 974 For the personality recognition task
RoBERTa performed best scoring an unweighted average
recall of 623 ChatGPT performed the worst on this task
getting an unweighted average recall of 540 Interestingly
Word2Vec and BoW models also performed marginally wewhen compared to ChatGPT for this taskWang et al In contrast to the aforementioned studies our research ex
plores the untapped potential of LLMs in annotating emotions
in speech data We present a novel approach that incorporates
audio context into LLMs to improve the precision of anno
tations To our knowledge no prior research has investigated
the utilisation of LLMs for annotating speech emotion dataIII METHODOLOGYIn our exploration of emotional data annotation we conduct
a series of experiments Firstly we annotate samples using
only text and then we incorporate audio features and gender
information alongside textual data for improved annotation To
incorporate audio context we utilise the average energy and
pitch of each utterance and pass it to ChatGPT Additionally
we propose the use of VQVAE to generate a 64dimensionadiscrete representation of audio which is also provided to
ChatGPT as the audio context For speechemotion classifi
cation we train a bidirectional LongShort Term Memory
BLSTMbased classifier The following section provides
further details on our proposed methodA VQVAE for Speech Code Generationset of discrete latent codes and the prior is learnt rather than
being fixed As illustrated in Figure 1 the model is comprised
of three main parts the encoder the vector quantiser and the
decoderThe encodertakes in the inputin the form of Mel
spectrograms and passes it through a series of convolutionalayers having a shape of n h w d where n is the batch size
h is the height w is the width and d represents the total number
of filters after convolutions Let us denote the output from the
encoder as ze The vector quantiser component contains an
embedding space with k total vectors each with dimension
d The main goal of this component is to output a series of
embedding vectors that we call zq To accomplish this we
first reshape ze in the form of n  h  w d and calculate
the distance for each of these vectors with the vectors in the
embedding dictionary For each of the n  h  w vectors we
find the closest of the k vectors from the embedding space
and index the closest vector from the embedding space for
each n  h  w vector The discrete indices of each of the
vectors in the embedding space are called codes and we get
a unique series of codes for each input to the model The
selected vectors are then reshaped back to match the shape of
ze Finally the reshaped vector embeddings are passed through
a series of transpose convolutions to reconstruct the originainput Melspectrogram One problem with this approach is that
the process of selecting vectors is not differentiable To tackle
this problem the authors simply copy the gradients from zq
to zeThe totaloss is composed of three loss elementsthe
reconstruction loss the code book loss and the commitment
loss The reconstruction loss is responsible for optimising the
encoder and decoder and is represented byReconstruction Loss  logpxzqWe use a code book loss which forces the vector embeddings
to move closer to the encoder output zeCode Book Loss  sgzex  e2
where sg is the stop gradient operator this essentially freezes
all gradient flows e are the vector embeddings and x is the
input to the encoder And finally for making sure that the
encoder commits to an embedding we add a commitment lossCommitment Loss  zex  sge2
here  is a hyperparameter that controls the weight we want
to assign to the commitment lossOverall we train the VQVAE model to represent the audio
representation in the form of a discrete list of integers or
codes These audio representations can be used in addition
to the transcriptions and fed to ChatGPT for annotation In
the following section we will delve into the details of the
annotation procedureWe propose to use a VectorQuantised Variational Autoen
coder VQVAE B Emotion Label Annotation using LLMsWe evaluated the data annotation ability of ChatGPT with
different experiments We start our experiments by annotat
ing the training data of IEMOCAP by passing the textuawhere i represents the attention weights that can be computed
as followsi expW T hi
j expW T hjcidFig 1 Model Diagram of the VQVAEtranscripts to ChatGPT and annotating the data both in zero
shot and fewshot settings For a few shots we randomly
selected 10 samples from the training data and passed them
to ChatGPT as context We trained the classifier using the
training samples annotated with ChatGPT and unweighted
average recall UAR is computed We repeat this procedure
of annotation by passing the audio features along with the
textual information First of all we use average pitch and
energy for a given utterance and reannotated the data both
in a zeroshot and a fewshots setting and classification UAR
is measured using a BLSTM based classifier As the female

voice usually has a high pitch and energy
also annotated the data by providing the gender informationFinally we propose to use an audio representation by VQ
VAE Section IIIA and pass it to ChatGPT as audio contextWe then used the OpenAI API with the ChatGPT pro
version to annotate the data In our approach we meticulously
designed and curated multiple prompts for annotating the data
leveraging ChatGPT for the annotation process We trained the
classifier on the annotated dataset and computed the UAR
considering it as a benchmark for evaluating the classification
performance To improve upon this benchmark we conducted
additional experiments exploring various prompts to enhance
the classification results beyond the established performance
leveC Speech Emotion ClassifierIn this work we implement convolutional neural network
CNNBLSTMbased classifiers due to their popularity in
SER research  It has been found that the performance of
BLSTM can be improved by feeding it with a good emotionarepresentation  Therefore we use CNN as emotional fea
ture extractor from the given input data  A CNN layer acts
like datadriven filter banks and can model emotionally salient
features We pass these emotional features to the BLSTM layer
to learn contextual information Emotions in speech are in
the temporal dimension therefore the BLSTM layer helps
model these temporal relationships  We pass the outputs
of BLSTM to an attention layer to aggregate the emotionasalient attributes distributed over the given utterance For a
given output sequence hi utterance level salient attributes are
aggregated as followsRattentive cidiihiwhere W is a trainable parameter The attentive representation
Rattentive computed by the attention layer is passed to the fully
connected layer for emotion classification Overall our classi
fier is jointly empowered by the CNN layers to capture an ab
stract representation the BLSTM layer for context capturing
the attention layer for emotional salient attributes aggregation
and the fully connected layer emotion classificationIV EXPERIMENTAL SETUPA DatasetsTo evaluate the effectiveness of annotations by ChatGPT
we use three datasets IEMOCAP MSPIMPROV and MELD
which are commonly used for speech emotion classification
the IEMOCAP and the MSP
research   Both
IMPROV datasets are collected by simulating naturalistic
dyadic interactions among professional actors and have similar
labelling schemes MELD contains utterances from the Friends
TV series1 IEMOCAP The Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion
Capture IEMOCAP database is a multimodal database that
contains 12 hours of recorded data  The recordings were
captured during dyadic interactions between five male and five
female speakers The Dyadic interactions enabled the speakers
to converse in unrehearsed emotions as opposed to reading
from a text The interactions are almost five minutes long
and are segregated into smaller utterances based on sentences
where each utterance is then assigned a label according to the
emotion Overall the dataset contains nine different emotionsTo be consistent with previous studies we use four emotions
including sad 1084 happy 1636 angry 1103 and neutra2 MSPIMPROV This corpus is a multimodal emotionadatabase recorded from 12 actors performing dyadic inter
actions  similar to IEMOCAP  The utterances in
MSPIMPROV are grouped into six sessions and each session
has recordings of one male and one female actor The sce
narios were carefully designed to promote naturalness while
maintaining control over lexical and emotional contents The
emotional labels were collected through perceptual evaluations
using crowdsourcing  The utterances in this corpus are
annotated in four categorical emotions angry happy neutral
and sad To be consistent with previous studies   we
use all utterances with four emotions anger 792 sad 885
neutral 3477 and happy3 MELD Multimodal EmotionLines Datasetthis configuration we get a total of 11353 utterances from the
datasetB Speech FeaturesFor utterances across all datasets we use a consistent
sampling rate of 16 kHz For extracting the audio features
we then convert the audio into Mel spectrograms The Mel
spectrograms are computed with a shorttime Fourier trans
form of size 1024 a hop size of 256 and a window size
of 1024 We specify a total of 80 Melbands for the output
and cutoff frequency of 8 kHz We set a cutoff length offor each Mel spectrogram to have a final shape of 80x256
where smaller samples are zeropadded Finally
the Mespectrograms are normalised in the range of 1 1C HyperparametersThe VQVAE was trained using the following parametersWe chose a batch size of 256 and trained for a total ofepochs with a learning rate of 1e4 The convolution layers
each had a stride and kernel size of 2 and 3 respectivelyA total of 8192 token embeddings were selected where each
had a dimensionality of 512 With our particular configuration
we got a total of 64 codes for each given utterance We pass
these codes to ChatGPT along with textual data for annotationBased on these annotations we trained over the classifierOur classifier consists of convolutional layers and a Bidi
rectional LSTM BLSTMbased classification network To
generate highlevel abstract feature representations we employ
two CNN layers In line with previous studies   we
utilise a larger kernel size for the first convolutional layer and
a smaller kernel size for the second layer The CNN layers
learn feature representations which are then passed to the
BLSTM layer with 128 LSTM units for contextual repre
sentation learning Following the BLSTM layer an attention
layer is applied to aggregate the emotional content spread
across different parts of the given utterance The resulting
attentive features are then fed into a dense layer withhidden units to extract emotionally discriminative features for
a softmax layer The softmax layer employs the crossentropy
loss function to calculate posterior class probabilities enabling
the network to learn distinct features and perform accurate
emotion classificationIn our experiments we utilise the Adam optimiser with its
default parameters The training of our models starts with a
learning rate of 00001 and at the end of each epoch we assess
the validation accuracy If the validation accuracy fails to
improve for five consecutive epochs we decrease the learning
rate by half and revert
to the bestperforming
the modeprevious epoch This process continues until the learning rate
drops below 000001 As for the choice of nonlinear activation
function we use the rectified linear unit ReLU due to its
superior performance compared to leaky ReLU and hyperbolic
tangent during the validation phaseV EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
All experiments are conducted in a speakerindependent
manner to ensure the generalisability of our findings Specif
ically we adopt an easily reproducible and widely usedleaveonespeakerout crossvalidation scheme as commonly
employed in related literature  For crosscorpus
SER we follow  A Within Corpus ExperimentsFor the withincorpus experiments we select the IEMO
CAP data and compare the results with the baseline UAR
achieved using actual true labels We trained the classifier
for different settings 1 true label settings 2 zeroshot
ChatGPT labels and 3 fewshots ChatGPT labels In the
first experiment we trained the CNNBSTMbased classifier
on true labels using the wellknown above mentioned leave
onespeakerout scheme   In the second and third
experiments the classifier is trained in the same leaveone
speakerout scheme however we annotated samples using
ChatGPT with our proposed approach We repeat the second
and third experiments using text only and text plus audio
context Results are presented in Figure 2 Overall results
on data annotated using few shots achieve improved results
compared to the zeroshot scenario It is important to noteFig 2 Comparing the classification performance UAR  using
training data annotated by ChatGPT and original IEMOCAP labelsthat the emotion classification performance using training data
annotated with only text is poor compared to the baselineHere baseline results represent when the classifier is trained
using the original annotations of IEMOCAP This observation
underscores the insufficiency of textuainformation alone
to provide the necessary context for accurate annotation by
ChatGPT Consequently additional context becomes essentiato enable ChatGPT in effectively annotating the data As previ
ously found for example happy and angry voice samples often
have high energy and pitch compared to a sad and neutral voice
 Building upon this insight we incorporated the average
energy and pitch values of a given utterance as additionacontextual information for ChatGPT during the reannotationprocess both in zeroshot and fewshot settings However the
performance improvement was not considerable primarily due
to the confounding factor of gender as female voices typically
exhibit higher pitch and energy compared to male voices To address this limitation we extended the experiment by
providing gender labels to ChatGPT resulting in improved
classification accuracy as illustrated in 2 In addition to average
energy pitch and gender information we further proposed the
utilisation of audio patterns to provide enhanced audio context
for annotation To achieve this we employed a VQVAE modeto encode the given utterance into discrete representationsThese representations along with the textual and other feature
inputs were employed in various experiments for annotation
refer to Figure 2 Notably in the zeroshot scenario no
substantial improvements were observed However significant
advancements were achieved by incorporating the discrete
codes generated by VQVAE in conjunction with average
energy pitch and gender informationB CrossCorpus EvaluationsIn this experiment we perform a crosscorpus analysis
to assess the generalisability of annotations performed using
our proposed approach Here we trained models on IEMO
CAP and testing is performed on the MSPIMPROV dataIEMOCAP is more blanched data

  for training by following previous studies
We randomly select 300  of the MSPIMPROV data for
parameter tuning and 700  of data as testing data We
report results using the fewshots annotation by ChatGPT as it
consistently demonstrated superior performance compared to
the zeroshot settingtherefore we selectTABLE I Crosscorpus evaluation results for speech emotion recog

SER In  the authors utilise the representations learnt
from unlabelled data and feed it to an attentionbased CNN

the classifiers performance can
be improved by augmenting the classifier with information
from unlabelled data We compare our results using the CNN
BLSTMbased classifier by using the IEMOCAP annotated by
the ChatGPT model This experiment demonstrates the gen
eralisability of annotations performed by ChatGPT in cross
corpus settings However it is worth noting that our results
did not surpass those of previous studies In the subsequent
experiment we aim to showcase the potential for enhancing
the performance of SER using data annotations generated by
ChatGPT both withincorpus and crosscorpus settingsC Augmentating the Training Datalike ChatGPT HoweverIn the previous two experiments we showed how we can
annotate new speechemotional data using a large language
modethe performance does not
surpass the UAR achieved using actual labels In this ex
periment we aim to address this limitation by showcasing
the potential of improving SER performance through data
augmentation using our proposed approach For this we can
utilise abundantly available audio data by annotating with our
proposed approach For instance data from YouTube can be
annotated and used to augment the SER system To validate
this concept we select the MELD dataset which consists of
dialogue samples from the Friends TV series We employ
the fewshot approach using samples from the IEMOCAP
dataset for fewshots and annotate the MELD data with four
emotions happy anger neutral and sad We used samples
from IEMOCAP data for the fewshots and annotated MELD
data in four emotions including happy anger neutral and
sad Results are presented in Figure 3 where we compare
the results with the CNNBLSTM classifier using the actuaIECMOAP labels and when data is augmented using the
samples with ChatGPT labels This analysis provides insights
into the effectiveness of data augmentation for enhancing the
performance of the SER systemFig 3 Comparing the classier performance UAR  with data

authors utilise DialogueRNN for speech emotion recognition
using IEMOCAP data Peng et al CNN network for emotion classification We achieve better
results compared to these studies by augmenting the classifier
with additional data annotated by ChatGPT One possible
reason can be that these studies did not train the models
with augmentation However we also compared the results
with  where the authors use different data augmentation
techniques to augment the classifier and achieve improved
results In contrast we use ChatGPT to annotate the publicly
available data and use it for augmentation of the training setWe are achieving considerably improved results compared to
 One possible reason is that we are adding new data in
the classifiers training set however authors in Overall our results showcase the effectiveness of our ap
proach in achieving superior performance compared to previ
ous studies both in withincorpus and crosscorpus settingsThe utilisation of ChatGPT for data annotation and augmen
tation proves to be a promising strategy for enhancing SER
systemsD LimitationsIn this section we highlight the potential limitations of our
work and in general the limitations of LLMs for data an
notation During our experiments we observed the following
limitations We obtained promising results by augmenting the training
data with samples annotated using ChatGPT However
this approach proved ineffective when applied to corpora
such as LibriSpeech  where the recordings lack
emotional variations Although we attempted to utilise
LibriSpeech data results are not shown here the results
were not as promising as those achieved with MELD ChatGPT is known to be sensitive to prompt variability
which can lead to ambiguous and erroneous results if
even slight changes are made to the prompt content In
order to address this issue we suggest conducting exper
iments using different prompts to generate annotations
as presented in Section IIIB The inclusion of more
context in the prompts has been shown to improve the
quality of results However for SER annotation prompts
this can be particularly challenging due to the significant
variability of human emotions within short time framesThis limitation stems from LLMs reliance on training
data ChatGPT has not been trained particularly to annotate
speech emotion data While the emergent nature of Chat
GPT has aided with annotation relying exclusively on
ChatGPT annotation is insufficient Through our research
we have found that incorporating ChatGPTbased annota
tions alongside the training data leads to enhanced classi
fication performance Notably when utilising multishotChatGPT annotations instead of zeroshot annotations we
observe a substantial performance improvement ChatGPT offers a significant cost reduction in data an
notation For instance in our experiments we were able
to annotate IEMOCAP data examples using ChatGPT for
approximately 30 USD which is significantly lower than
human annotations cost However it is paramount to note
that the accuracy of ChatGPTbased annotations is not
as good as human annotations because ChatGPT is not
specifically trained for annotating speech emotion dataAs a result it is a tradeoff situation Therefore it be
comes a tradeoff between cost and accuracy Striking the
right balance is crucial when utilising ChatGPT for data
annotation to avoid potential inaccuracies in classification
performanceDespite the mentioned limitations we have found ChatGPT
to be an invaluable tool for speechemotion data annotationWe believe that its capabilities will continue to evolve Cur
rently generating annotations using ChatGPT and incorporat
ing them to augment humanannotated data has demonstrated
improved performance in speech emotion classification This
highlights the potential of ChatGPT as a valuable asset in
advancing research in this fieldVI CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOKIn this paper we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of
ChatGPTs effectiveness in annotating speech emotion dataTo the best of our knowledge this study is the first of its
kind to explore the capabilities of ChatGPT in the domain of
speech emotion recognition The results of our investigation
have been encouraging and we have discovered promising
outcomes Below are the key findings of our study Based on our findings we observed that textbased emo
tional annotations do not generalise effectively to speech
data To address this limitation we introduced a noveapproach that harnesses the audio context in annotating
speech data leveraging the capabilities of a large lan
guage model By incorporating the audio context we
successfully enhanced the performance of SER yielding
improved results compared to the textbased approach We observed that the quality of annotations by ChatGPT
considerably improved when using a fewshot approach
compared to a zeroshot one By incorporating a smanumber of annotated samples we were able to achieve
improved results in our evaluation We introduced an effective technique to utilise large
language models LLMs to augment the speech emotion
recognition SER system with the annotated data by
ChatGPT The augmented system yielded improved re
sults compared to the current stateoftheart SER systems
that utilise conventional augmentation techniquesIn our future work we aim to expand our experimentation
by applying our approach to new datasets and diverse contextsThis will allow us to further validate the effectiveness and gen
eralisability of our proposed technique Additionally we plan
to explore and compare the annotation abilities of different
LLMs for speech emotion data enabling us to gain insightsinto their respective strengths and weaknesses We also intend
to use LLMs in the training pipeline of the SER system

processing primarily utilised versions of Convolutional Neu
ral Networks CNNs  However the inability of these
CNNbased methodologies to encapsulate the sequentiaessence of speech data was a substantial disadvantage This
shortcoming led to the inception of sequencetosequence

Processing tasks Despite their potency seq2seq models have
certain restrictions For instance they struggle to leverage
parallel computing hardware efficiently and have difficulty
in modelling longterm contexts due to their inherently
sequential naturesequences has been instrumental in the creation of LLMs with
billions of parameters such as GPT3 This breakthrough
in capturing contextual information has extended beyond
text generation to various modalities like speech and audio
giving rise to the emergence of Large Audio Models that
have transformed tasks such as speech recognition emotion
detection and music generation We discuss the Large Audio
Model in the next subsection22 Transformers for Audio Processing23 Overview of Large Language ModelsTransformers utilise selfattention mechanisms to capture
temporal correlations from sequential data  This equips
transformers with the ability to capture extensive temporacontexts while maintaining reduced computational complex
ity Transformers employ selfattention layers to effectively
capture distant relationships within input sequences unlike
traditional RNNs which struggle with such interactions Self
attention also enables greater parallelisation compared to
RNNs allowing transformers to process speech sequences
holistically without relying on past states Vaswani et al Furthermore transformers have not only revolutionised
natural language processing and audio processing but have
also paved the way for the development of LLMs that can
understand generate and interact with human language
and its underlying contexts in increasingly nuanced and
sophisticated ways Their remarkable ability to efficiently
capture contextual dependencies and relationships withinInvestigations reveal that the act of scaling pretrained lan
guage models PLMs either through enhancing the modesize or expanding the data size typically yields superior
model performance on subsequent tasks adhering to what is
known as the scaling law  Numerous investigations have
probed the limits of performance by training increasingly
larger PLMs such as the GPT3 model with 175 billion
parameters and the PaLM model with 540 billion parametersWhile the majority of scaling endeavours primarily focus on
model size preserving similar architectures and pretraining
tasks these expanded PLMs exhibit distinct characteristics
compared to their smaller counterparts such as BERT with
330 million parameters and GPT2 with 15 billion parametersThey exhibit unexpected proficiency referred to as emergent
abilities in tackling a variety of intricate tasks For example
GPT3 has demonstrated the ability to address fewshot tasks
via incontext learning a feat that GPT2 struggles withHence the term large language models LLMs has been
coined by the research community to describe these enlarged
PLMs and these models have garnered increasing interestA notable example of an LLM application is ChatGPT which
adapts the GPT series LLMs for dialogue showcasing excep
tional conversational capabilities with humans A significant
surge in arXiv papers pertaining to LLMs can be observed

addition the AudioLDM model enables a number of other
audiorelated tasks to be performed in zeroshot fashion such
as textguided superresolution inpainting and style transferBuilt on the success of AudioLDM the authors have created a
more advanced model called AudioLDM 2  which aims
to develop a general audio representation method called
language of audio LOA for speech music and generasound effects With this method a single foundation modeis learned with the same method and is able to generate
highquality speech music and sound effects The self

any audio modality into the language of audio With the
LOA representation the audio signal can be generated with
a selfsupervised learning process with a LDM with LOA

used to convert the audio scripts into computer programs

to evolve these innovations underscore the capacity of
language models to bridge the gap between speech and
text opening up new avenues for more efficient and effective
solutions in speech processing and understanding32 Neural Speech SynthesisNeural speech synthesis also referred to as Neural textto
speech TTS is considered an important area of research
with the aim of generating humanlike speech from the
text Traditional TTS systems have complex architecture
by encompasses intricate components including acoustic
frontends duration models acoustic prediction models
and vocoder models This complexity of TTS systems has
recently been overcome with the advent of deep endtoend
TTS architectures These systems possess the capacity to
generate convincingly realistic speech by being trained on
pairs of text and audio Popular TTs models include Tacotron Deep Voice model  and Clarinet  and many
other  These models produce Melspectrograms from
textual inputs which are subsequently employed for speech
synthesis by vocoders like GriffinLim  WaveNet 
and Waveglow  Lately transformers become popular
structures in TTS by showing improved performance and
accelerated training More recently Large Audio Models have become popular
in solving problems in TTS research Various studies either
utilise LLMs or develop Large Audio Models to show their
effectiveness in the TTS domain For example Kakouros et
al Wang et al speakers voice emotion and acoustic context is a prominent
aspect of VALLE Xs performanceKharitonov et al Maiti et al Wang et al 2  TABLE 5 Neural speech synthesis comparison using Lib

speech from the source language into the target languageST systems are typically categorised into two main groupscascaded systems and endtoend systems Cascaded ST
systems comprise an automatic speech recognition ASRcomponent and a machine translation MT component In
contrast endtoend ST systems aim to optimise a singlemodel that directly translates the spoken utterance into the
target language Various studies have explored methods
and techniques to improve both cascaded ST systems In the landscape of recent advancements the introduction
of SeamlessM4T Dong et aEnCodec The training procedure of the model has been
previously outlined in the model section 24 As a result they
found the model achieving improvement in BLUE scoresThe integration of speech and language training is
confronted by challenges stemming from data and GPrequirements as well as the inherent distinctions between
spoken and textual information Le et al In summary the landscape of speech translation is
evolving rapidly with a growing focus on bridging the
gap through innovative Large Audio Models The studies
discussed in this section as outlined in 24 underscore the
progress in this field From leveraging large language models
like AudioPaLM to tackle multilingual speech translation
to the development of VioLA a versatile language modeproficient in speechrelated tasks these advancements hold
the potential to revolutionise the accuracy and naturalness
of translated speech As the demand for seamless communi
cation across languages continues to rise these models offer
a promising path forward in achieving enhanced speech
translation capabilities34 Spoken Dialogue SystemsSpoken dialogue systems SDSs have garnered significant
attention in the audio processing community due to their
versatile applications in customer service and goaloriented
humancomputer interactions These systems encompass key
components such as speech recognition intent recognition
a knowledge base andor database backend a dialogue
manager language generation and speech synthesis Within the architecture of SDSs the dialogue manager plays
a pivotal role in making action selections based on observed
events  Researchers have effectively demonstrated how
RNNs and transformers can be employed to optimise action
selection adeptly modelling the dynamic nature of spoken
dialogue using fully or partially observable Markov Decision
Processes However transformers have recently emerged
as a superior alternative to RNNs to optimise the action
selection process within SDSs 192 193 By leveraging theirselfattention mechanism transformers have demonstrated
exceptional capabilities in modelling dynamic dialogue
system scenarios This evolution has led to numerous studies that harness
the power of transformers to enhance spoken dialogue
systems While textbased dialogue systems can be trained
directly on extensive text data 195 196 a large number
of SDSs have relied on user simulations for training due
to the scarcity of real training dialogues available for both
training and evaluation purposes
 The integration
of transformers into SDSs presents a promising avenue for
improving dialogue management offering the potential to
better comprehend user inputs context and preferences
thus leading to more effective and natural interactionsFurthermore the advances made in LLMs such as those
used in chat systems and Large Audio Models have also
paved the way for transformative changes in spoken dialogue
systems By leveraging knowledge acquired from pretrained
LLMs and Large Audio Models current and future SDSs
may no longer require training from scratch or in isolation
from other models Instead SDSs can inherit knowledge
from large languageaudiomultimodal models to bootstrap
their input features finetune or guide their behaviour and
potentially improve their performance While direct usage
of LLMs for taskoriented dialogue systems has shown
to underperform in comparison with taskspecific models
careful application is required for LLMs to be usefulas
shown by However recent developments on LLMsbased dialogue
systems are mostly textbased and their application to
spoken dialogue systems audiobased conversational AI and
their applications largely remain unexplored A few excep
tions using reasonably Large Audio Models include dialogue
generation from raw audio excluding text processing in their
pipeline  dialogue policy learning from textual and
audio features for taskoriented dialogues  and open
and closeddomain dialogue generation  Other works
on audiobased dialogue generation from audio features
using Large Audio Models include SpeechGPT  Sound
Storm  AudioGPT  and dGSLM Further
recent studies such as ANGIE  MultimodalGPT
and Large Multimodal Models The studies above have provided valuable insights re
garding the potential applications and capabilities of large
language and audio models within the context of SDSs In the
next years we should expect a lot more influence of LLMs
applied to SDSsincluding speech and audio data among
others in their learnt representations instead of only textin
order to improve their performance and acceptance by end
users in a wide range of tasks But additional aspects wihave to be taken into consideration such as scarcity of audio
and multimodal dialogue data with representative amounts
of transcriptions and annotations safety of dialogues and
evaluations in real scenarios beyond simplified datasets35 Large Audio Models in MusicDeep Learning DL models find widespread application
in content generation spanning various domains such as
images text and music Particularly in music generation
DLs adaptability shines allowing it to learn from a wide
array of musical sources and enabling the creation of diverse
genres This sets it apart from conventional methods The advent of transformers renowned for their capacity to
grasp intricate patterns and interdependencies in sequentiadata has brought about a revolution in music generation By
comprehending longrange dependencies harmonies and
subtleties transformers have transformed the landscape of
music generation 210 211 This transformation owes much
to the selfattention mechanism within transformers which
incorporates a global context during the music composition
process resulting in outputs that are more coherent and
sophisticated  Moreover the emergence of Large Music
Models with transformers as a fundamental block has further
elevated music generation These models harness the power
of large AI models to craft music that resonates with human
emotion and creativity thus shaping the landscape of music
composition in innovative and compelling ways Below we
provide an extensive overview of Large Audio Models with a
focus on music signal processingSeveral prominent Large Audio Models have emerged to ad
vance the realm of music generation For instance Garcia et
alSimilarly Ghosal et al AudioCaps dataset  which consists of 45438 audio
samples To assess the quality of the audio generated from
the melspectrograms produced by the VAE decoder Ghosaet al utilised the vocoder introduced by Liu et al Benchmarking TANGO against established models such
as DiffSound  AudioGen  and AudioLDM As presented in Section 24 Liu et al Wu et al Donahue et amodel the authors utilised a dataset consisting of 1 million
audio samples which translates to roughly 46000 hours of
music SingSongs foundation is anchored in AudioLM Throughout the training phase the model is fed source
separated vocals as input while the instrumental tracks
act as the target To counteract any artefacts in the vocals
that might originate from instrumental segments white
noise was incorporated into the input Semantic codes were
mined using a pretrained w2vBERT model  and
coarse acoustic codes were extracted using a pretrained
SoundStream codec  In addition they used T5 
an encoderdecoder transformer  to predict the output
codes The decoding operation was facilitated by Sound
Stream Results show that SingSong stands out as a potent
tool for producing instrumental music that aligns with given
vocals thereby enriching the music generation landscape
with added creativity and depthOu et al Lam et al 3  docwav2vec2conformerFig 7 An overview of WavJourney  Initially the LLM serves as an audio scriptwriter offering users an interactive and

versational capabilities designed to understand and execute

that LLaSM provides a more userfriendly and intuitive

by the emergence of Large Audio Models Researchers are
increasingly exploring the potential of these models to tackle
a wide range of speechrelated tasks Table 2 provides an
overview of these studies These large audio models such as
SpeechX and AudioGPT demonstrate their versatility and
proficiency in handling diverse speechrelated tasks4 CHALLENGES AND OUTLOOK
In this section we outline the potential challenges and future
directions for Large Audio Models or the use of textual LLMs
to improve audiorelated tasks These challenges include
the known shortcomings and unintended consequences
of exporting LLMs to domains for which they are explic
itly trained We also incorporate the challenges that have
emerged from the attempts to design foundational models
for audio processing It is important to note that these
challenges are not exhaustive as research in this area is
rapidly growing Here we also want to note that LLMs have
achieved remarkable results in language modelling and other
discrete sequential tasks However directly applying LLMs
to audio is challenging as audio is inherently analogue and
continuous over time Vector quantisation variational autoen
coder VQVAE helps address this issue by discretising the
speech modality so it can be handled by LLM architecturesVQVAE models the continuous timeseries input using a
discrete latent codebook through vector quantisation This
allows audio data like spectrograms to be reconstructed from
codes while retaining most information about dynamicsCoupling an LLM with the discrete representations learned
by VQVAE provides a way for the LLM to indirectly
model the continuous nature of the input audio signal Exploring these challenges opens up exciting possibilities for
advancing audiorelated tasks and pushing the boundaries
of what LLMs can achieve in this domain41 Data IssuesLLMs or Large Audio Models are trained on expansive datasets
rendering the assessment and validation of the quantity and
quality of data essential for pretraining LLMs in speech
and audio processing a virtually insurmountable task The
pragmatic difficulties tied to evaluating data quality give
rise to a multitude of concerns encompassing issues such as
duplicated data instances contamination bias and a diverse
array of others411 Doppelganger Data InstancesDoppelganger data instances emerge as data that exhibit
a resemblance yet lack complete identity They manifest in
various forms including recurring words and sentences
comparable speech characteristics similar structure and
representation and more Detecting these instances within
a dataset presents a significant challenge as they can be
nearly indistinguishable from authentic data entries The
existence of these doppelgangers can significantly impact the
performance of Large Audio Models as theres a considerable
chance that such models might memorise and subsequently
reproduce them leading to diminished performance Ad
dressing this issue requires the compulsory removal of these
doppelganger instances achieved through the elimination of
repeated words and sentences coupled with the utilisation
of diverse ML techniques for structural comparisons Lee etal 412 Data ContaminationData Contamination as an issue is becoming an Achilles heeof LLMs The impracticality of screening the data for pre
training the LLMs makes it harder to ensure that evaluation
data is not used in the pretraining phase This contamination
affects the performance of the benchmarking phase of the
LLMs In speech and audio processing background noise
audio distortion outofdistribution examples label noise
offensive content etc are issues causing contamination in

is a technique used to control inherited data contamination
by providing details of the ancestor models and weights
used for training a new LLM model Jacovi et al 413 Personally Identifiable InformationThe personal information is part and parcel of the data
crawled from the Internet on which most of the textual LLMs
are trainedpretrained Phone numbers email addresses
and other personally identifiable information can and are
part of that data Though LLM developer companies use
techniques such as scrubbing privacypreserving training
anonymisation and tokenisation to resolve personally iden
tifiable information problems it persists More than a few
incidents are reported in the literature where LLMs have
outputted the personal information in servicing particular
prompts 252256 Carlini et alaw domains and showed that even after using modern
scrubbing techniques 3 personally identifiable information
is leaked It highlights the flaw in data collection processing
and scrubbing techniques used for trainingpretraining
LLMs They also launched an attack on GPT2 and showed
that the leakage of personal information increased nearly
ten times which is an alarming issue A few more studies
have also highlighted the leakage of personally identifiable
information and despite the measures taken by various
LLM designing companies the issue still pertains and causes
concernsRecently there has been a surge in proposals for Large
Audio Models which makes it all the more imperative to
assess and address similar challenges in the context of these
Large Audio Models414 Diverse Pretraining DataThe downstream performance of Large Audio Models is
intricately linked to the diversity present in the training
and pretraining datasets  Given the immense scale of
audio corpora collected from various sources understanding
the individual contributions and relative weights of each
source in the learning process remains elusive  This
limitation becomes particularly apparent when these models
are presented with multidomain information This challenge
is not unique to speech and audio processing a paralleissue is observed in models designed for text processingSpeech data introduces several associated variables such
as background noise language variability genderspecific
speech features and more Striking a harmonious balance
between data from diverse domains is crucial otherwise the
transferability of knowledge for downstream applications
may suffer consequently restricting performanceWhile a few studies 260 261 on textual LLMs have
outlined methods for weighting multidomain data this
challenge remains unresolved in the context of speech and
audio processing Lee et al 42 TokenisationTokenisation is a critical component of LLMs It is the process
of dividing words or letters into smaller chunks  Tokens
are used to cope with terms that are not in the models lexiconTokens are often restricted in size because expanding the
token space increases computation complexity Tokenisation
is a critical processing step in the pipelines of ChatGPT
and other LLMs Though tokenisation has enabled LLMs
it also brings complications such as computational costlanguage reliance handling of new terms fixed vocabulary
size information loss and limited human interpretability
to name a few  Petrov et al The continuous nature of audio signals speech variability
and background noise compound the challenge of tokeni
sation in Large Audio Models Variations in pronunciations
and overlapping speech further restrict tokenisation benefitsMultilingual speech tokenisation poses additional complexi
ties as the same statement might demand a varying number
of tokens in different languages Similarly tokenising the
emotion in the speech is challenging posing the risk of infor
mation loss AudioPaLM cites the quality of the tokenisation
as a key limitation in lessening the performance Similarly
SpeechGPT and SpeechX also suggest that tokenisation
is a potential limitation in their performance There have
been recent attempts in designing and testing a few speech
tokenisers  but overall tokenisation for speechaudio
data processing requires further attention As we look ahead
addressing the challenges surrounding tokenisation in the
context of large audio models data processing remains an
essential avenue for research and development Zhang et a43 Computational Cost and Energy RequirementsPretraining a large audio model requires a massive amount
of audio data and compute hours The compute hours need
millions of US dollars worth of energy AudioGPT withbillion parameters requires approximately 1 million kilowatt
hours kWh which is approximately 137 million USDSimilarly the training cost of the stateoftheart AudioPaLM
with 530 billion parameters is approximately 530 million
USD While a few recent attempts have been made to reduce
the computational cost and energy usage 93 267269 the
race to the state of the art in various audiorelated tasks
is quickly pushing up the pretraining cost The amount of
energy consumed in training these LLMs also hurts climate
change and carbon emissions as the power needed to run
the GPU and TPU clusters for pretraining Finetuning is another aspect of LLMs that requires
considerable computing power although not as much as
pretraining and usually a large amount of memory to store
the model Finetuning is a technique that adapts a pre
trained model to a specific domain or task using a smadataset It is typically used for downstream applications
and has proven useful for designing various speech and
textbased applications Finetuning LLMs for speech and
audio processing can be limited by memory requirementsThe memory requirements of finetuning are the same
as those of pretraining which can be a bottleneck fordownstream applications Although there exist efficient fine
tuning techniques like parameter efficient training prompt
based efficient tuning and memory efficient tuning for text
processing 94 271273 comparable methods are limited
for speech and audio processing 218 274 275 The need
for specialised finetuning techniques tailored to the nuances
of audio processing remains evident As the field advances
addressing the memory challenges of finetuning will be
pivotal to unlocking the full potential of Large Audio Models
for realworld applications44 Limited context lengthLarge Audio Models downstream applications require context
understanding for making intelligent decisions this limits
the quantity of data that the model may access when
generating predictions It is especially difficult for tasks
requiring longterm dependency understanding such as
speech recognition  Second the model may struggle to
understand the links between distinct portions of a speech
signal because of the short context length This can cause
issues with activities like speaker identification and emotion
recognition Finally the models short context duration may
make generalisation for fresh data difficult This is because
the model was only trained on a tiny quantity of data making
it difficult for it to understand how to cope with novecircumstances There are a few techniques in the literature
for sorting out the challenges posed by the limited contextThese techniques are efficient attention mechanisms 277
280 length generalisation 178 281284 and transformer
alternatives 285288 An efficient attention mechanism
helps decrease the context length while ensuring limited
computational overhead on the transformer architecture
length generalisation methods use positional embeddings to
circumvent the limited context length issues and transformer
alternatives can provide options for using techniques that
do not run into issues context lengths As the field advances
addressing the limitations of context understanding will be
integral to unlocking the full potential of Large Audio Models
applications45 Understanding Paralinguistic InformationParalinguistic information such as emotions plays a pivotarole in speech as they establish a connection with its inherent
meaning and categorisation Even identical utterances can
acquire distinct meanings when expressed with different
emotions  While LLMs excel in speech generation
their capacity to comprehend and generate various emotions
remains largely untapped and understudied Zhang et al A compelling proposition materialises embedding the
ability to generate and comprehend emotions stands the next substantial stride in the evolution of Large Audio
Models By enriching these models with emotional depth they
hold the potential to substantially enhance their capacity to
communicate resonate and connect with human expression
in various contexts Moreover the field of music generation
stands as another avenue poised for exploration within the
purview of large music models Just as with emotions in
speech musics emotional intricacies are deeply intertwined
with its tonal rhythmic and structural components Large
Audio Models that cannot only understand but also generate
music with diverse emotional qualities could usher in a new
era of creativity and emotional engagement in music produc
tion and consumption The fusion of emotions and music
generation could pave the way for even more comprehensive
and impactful interactions with Large Audio Models shaping
the future of humanAI collaboration in both spoken and
musical aspects46 Prompt SensitivityPrompts are the way to interact with LLMs They act as a
query or input to the LLM and in response to the query the
LLM generates the response It is now well known that a
slight change in a prompt that is not perceptible to humans
can disrupt the LLMs entire response This brittleness
can cause serious consequences when LLMs are deployed
in responsecritical applications such as healthcare 
finance  and law  Large Audio Models engaged
in speech processing tasks such as speaker identification
speech classification and speech translation are equally
vulnerable to prompt variations Studies have begun to delve
into comprehending the ramifications of prompt brittleness
on generating labels for speechbased affective computing
tasks Recent advancements including singleturn prompting
incontext learning multiturn prompting and the chain
of thought have gained prominence  However these
techniques have primarily demonstrated their efficacy in
textbased applications where furnishing context in plain
language proves adequate Intriguingly in the domain of
Large Audio Models a notable void exists Despite the progress
made to our knowledge the literature has yet to explore the
design and testing of specialised prompts tailored specifically
for speechbased scenarios Addressing this gap presents an
intriguing avenue for research one that could pave the way
for enhanced interactions with Large Audio Models47 HallucinationHallucination is a challenging issue in LLMs It is a behaviour
where LLMs generate factually incorrect information that
is difficult to detect due to the large number of outputs
that LLMs generate  Ji et al Intrinsic hallucinations occur when LLMs misun
derstand the source content and generate factually
incorrect information Extrinsic hallucinations occur when the LLM
generated output cannot be substantiated from the
source data or contradicts itThe occurrence of hallucinations is not limited to text
based LLMs Large Audio Models are also susceptible This
susceptibility can lead to misinterpretations of audio sources
altered reasoning and the introduction of random noise To
mitigate this issue the literature suggests several strategies
including adversarial training diversification in training data
human feedback incorporation contrastive learning and
enhanced regularisation 88 295298 It is notable however
that discussions around the hallucination challenge within
Large Audio Models remain somewhat limited Given the growing prominence of models like Au
dioPaLM SpeechGPT and others in applications such as
speaker recognition and speech translation addressing and
comprehending the hallucination challenge in the context
of Large Audio Models holds considerable significance It
is imperative to proactively tackle this issue to ensure
the reliability and accuracy of these models in realworld
applications48 EthicsAs Large Audio Models continue to gain prominence across
diverse applications addressing their ethical challenges
becomes a paramount concern These models are trained
on extensive datasets sourced from the internet a practice
that brings with it the risk of inheriting ingrained biases Such
biases can dangerously influence the output generated by
these models inadvertently propagating content that reflects
racism sexism or other forms of discrimination Moreover
these datasets might inadvertently encompass personally
identifiable information potentially compromising individ
ual privacy The intrinsic generative capabilities of Large
Audio Models introduce an additional layer of complexity
allowing for the creation of convincing deep fakes that pose
a significant security threat to downstream applicationsWithin this evolving landscape music generation with
Large Audio Models offers exciting prospects for increased
creative engagement and novel artistic expression However
it also carries the power to reshape musical culture and
redefine economic dynamics  Constructing a music
generation system that involves user initiative like singing
and preserves individual identity in the output holds promise
for enhancing creative participation Yet ethical concerns
arise from the potential lack of user control over the genre
and style of the generated instrumental output To address
this refining the system to offer users explicit control over
these attributes becomes essential mitigating the potentiarisks This intricate balance between creative empowerment
and potential biases exemplifies the multifaceted ethicalandscape that surrounds the utilisation of Large Audio Models
in music generationSimilarly the capabilities of Large Audio Models to syn
thesise highquality structured audio content hold immense
potential across varied domains Nevertheless they also
inherit challenges similar to their textbased counterparts in
cluding societal biases present in training data Moreover the
generated speech might not consistently align with intended
accents or dialects for marginalised groups The potentiafor these models to continue short speech segments while
preserving speaker identity and prosody raises concerns
of potential misuse  demanding the implementationof responsible AI practices By delving into these nuances
the discourse on ethical challenges associated with Large
Audio Models expands to encompass a wide spectrum of
concerns underscoring the need for robust safeguards and
strategic deployment strategies As the foundational research
in this area grows the insights presented here along with
related works can serve as a valuable guide to understand
ing the complexities and addressing the challenges in the
development of improved Large Audio Models for audio
applications 23 30 299 3005 CONCLUSION
In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence
the role of large AI models in particular LLMs in audio
processing  including domains such as speech and music 
is becoming increasingly pivotal This paper offers the first
comprehensive survey on Large Audio Models capturing the
nuanced interplay of various LLMs within the audio sectorBy consolidating stateoftheart methods and surfacing
current challenges we provide a valuable resource for
researchers aiming to navigate this terrain Furthermore

machine learning ML big data network analytics and network

selves The idea that networks should learn to drive themselves is
gaining traction and there is a lot of interest in the networking com
munity to develop selfdriving networks  The idea itself is not
entirely new and reflects a recurring motif seen in various guises
such as cognitive networking  selforganized networks 
knowledge defined networks  and most recently datadriven
networking The vision of selfdriving networks is promising and finds much
encouragement from recent advances in ML such as deep learningand networking such as softwaredefined networks programmable
data planes and edge computing However there are many chal
lenges that remain Most notably modern networks and their in
tegration into the global Internet yields a complex adaptive sociasystem that encompasses the interaction of a vast diversity of au
tonomous devices human users applications and service providersComplex adaptive systems are characterized by their dynamic com
plexity and nonlinearity due to which the act of playing the game
has a way of changing the rules  Any selfdriving network
must acknowledge and address this complexity Hence the reaconcern is not to only see the potential benefits of the approach to
the optimizing entity itself but to also critically understand poten
tial downsides and unintended consequences on other subsystemsIn this work we seek to investigate the pros and cons of selfdriving
networks using systems thinking techniques11 What is Systems Thinking
Although many different definitions of systems thinking have been
proposed  all of them share an emphasis on interconnected
ness and interdependency They focus on understanding how vari
ous system entities influence each other and in turn themselves
through feedback loops The goal is to facilitate users in seeing
the proverbial forest for the trees  Systems thinking is char
acterized by three important features firstly the ability to think
dynamically secondly to think causally through feedback loops
thirdly to think more deeply about endogenous influences where
the system itself is the cause of the observed problems  Sys
tems thinking is different from conventional thinking in many ways
see Table 1 but most prominently in modeling complex systems
nonlinear closedlooped and multicausal with delayed feedback
rather than linear openlooped causal with immediate feedbackSystems thinking has made a big impact in research on complex
adaptive systems In such systems researchers have noted thatOn Analyzing SelfDriving NetworksA Systems Thinking ApproachSelfDN 2018 August 24 2018 Budapest Hungary

Fix the systemic causeshardly anything is influenced linearly in just one direction and the
presence of multiple intertwined nonlinear feedback loops have
made social systems notorious for being counterintuitive  In
terms of selfdriving networks this implies that it is not sufficient
to optimize only a protocol an architecture or a network without
reasoning about how this will influence the other parts technical as
well as sociocultural aspects of the larger Internet system Systems
thinking the right tool for understanding complex adaptive sociasystems since it is considered axiom in systems thinking that every
influence is both a cause and an effect 44 47 and that interactions
between subsystems are modeled by circular loops rather than
directed arrowsWe can define a system as an interconnected set of elements
that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something  a
definition given by Donella Meadows a highly influential system
thinker and the lead author of the bestselling Limits to Growth
 The something in the definition may however be quite dif
ferent from what the designer intended If we find some stubborn
problems with a system that refuse to go away despite efforts and
best intentions some authors call these wicked problems  it is
likely that these problems are systemic ie the problems follow
from how the system is built and from its architectural choices
goals and constraints Systems thinking opens us up to the fact
that wicked problems may not be resolvable through further in
terventions and that using more advanced technology is not always
good or neutral  Thus systems thinking may be defined as
the ability to understand the systemic interconnections in such a way
as to achieve a desired purpose  For more information about
systems thinking we refer to various primers 12 Contributions of This Paper
In this paper we aim to highlight that the Internet and selfdriving
networks should be envisioned as complex adaptive systems in
which we should be wary of easy solutions and quick fixes As
pointed out by H L Mencken theres always an easy solution to
every problem that is neat plausible but wrong In a similar vein
systems thinking research informs us that most wellintentioned
solutions fail to sustainably solve their addressed problems and
may actually create more problems than they solve However not
all solutions are doomed in this mannersome highleverage
solutions exist that can provide sustainable longrun benefits with
minimum effort and these can be uncovered by systems thinkingWe propose the use of tools and insights from systems thinking in
selfdriving networks for managing the unintended consequences
of policies and for devising highleverage effective solutions To
the best of our knowledge this is the first proposal to use systems
thinking insights and tools for the study of selfdriving networks
and possibly also for the Internet2 WHY USE SYSTEMS THINKING FORSELFDRIVING NETWORKS21 Leveraging a rich set of theory and tools
Systems thinking has been successfully used as a management tooto study policymaking in domains such as healthcare education
management As an example of a qualitative system thinking tool consider
causal loop diagram CLD which is an aid to visualize and easily
communicate how different system entities connect to each other
and influence each other possibly with a delay through reinforcing
positive or balancing negative feedback loops This could be
used to capture various aspects of decision making within modern
networks For instance Content Delivery Networks CDNs exert
significant influence on the traffic generated within ISPs by dynam
ically setting the destinations of a large fraction of flows This has
longterm impacts on ISP decision making as well as transient ef
fects on relevant content producers transit providers and exchange
points It has been hypothesized that integrating the control loops
of these parties could have significant mutual benefits  Self
driving networks offers a means to attain this but a vital precursor
would be formalizing the influences and dependencies between
these stakeholders CLDs offer a perfect tooIn contrast to CLDs the stock and flow diagram is a quantitative
system thinking tool for understanding systemic structure Stocks
or accumulators are things that accumulate and can be measured
eg population bits transferred energy spent while flows or
rates represents things that change over time eg transmission
rate Unlike CLDs stock and flow diagrams can provide informa
tion about rates of change Due to the lack of space we limit our
discussion to these two tools only but highlight that the field has a
number of other tools details of which can be seen in 22 Support for rigorous big picture thinking
Systems thinking also affords us the ability to see the big picture by
expanding our time and thought horizons Using system thinking
tools we can take better policy decisions regarding selfdriving
networks and avoid an exclusive reliance on implicit mental mod
els which are illsuited for this task since they are simplistic since
they inadvertently substitute a higherorder nonlinear system for a1In this paper we consider systems thinking to be synonymous with system dynamicsSelfDN 2018 August 24 2018 Budapest HungaryYaqoob et alinear causal one narrow ie not broad enough to see the big pic
ture and myopic since they tend to discount the future and focus
predominantly on the shortterm  Systems thinking can also
be used to better understand the connections between the various
subsystems In particular it helps us identify nonobvious connec
tions between effects and causes and also find missing connections
which if they had existed would have improved the system perfor
mance of our selfdriving networks23 Finding highleverage interventions
In systems thinking systems respond to interventions according to
the principle of leverage  Previous research in system dynam
ics has shown that most intuitively obvious policy interventions
in complex social systems are lowleverage ie they do not pro
duce significant longrun change and will likely also create other
problems and only a few policy interventions are highleverage
ie capable of producing substantial longrun change System
dynamics research has consistently highlighted the counterintu
itive nature of complex social systems in that the highleverage
points are not where most people expect and if even these points
are identified they are prone to be altered in the wrong direction
by people  In an influential essay on leverage  Donella
Meadows stated that interventions that rely only on parameter
optimization are typically low leverage and higher leverage can be
attained through deeper interventions that for example optimize
information flows eg by minimizing information sharing delaysor change the system rules ie the incentives and the constraints
the most powerful way to change a system Meadows notes is to
change the system goals and paradigm out of which its goals rules
and culture emerge Although these ideas are abstract we can use
insights about leverage points to unearth the few sensitive influ
ence points in selfdriving networks thereby avoiding some of the
problems that have plagued traditional networks24 Facilitating systemascause thinking
In systems thinking it is considered an axiom that every influence
is both a cause and an effectie it is possible that when A causes B
B also causes A through a feedback loopin such doubly looped sys
tem the systems are said to cause their own behavior endogenouslyWe can use the systems thinking concept of systemasacause to
explain how the perennial Internet nuisances such as spam and
lack of privacy security and QoS are not isolated problems but
as noted by Keshav 25 Management of unintended consequences
Unintended consequences are the staple of complex social systems
which follow unexpectedly from the nonlinear interactions between
subsystems including future selfdriving networks are not immune to this
tendency  Systems thinking can help us anticipate and avoid the
negative consequences of wellintentioned solutions This can be
done both prospectively by anticipating unintended consequences
during strategic planning or retrospectively by understanding more
deeply the nonobvious causes of existing chronic complex sociaproblems3 SYSTEM MISBEHAVIOR ARCHETYPES
System dynamics literature is rife with examples of fixes gone
wrongin which wellintentioned commonsense interventions
to mitigate a particular problem has gone on to aggravate it not
to mention the creation of other problems  Peter Senge the
author of the bestselling systems thinking book  devised a
list of system laws generalized from manifestations of commonly
observed system behavior in diverse settings and many of these
laws are somber reminders of how systems can misbehave and
how solutions can themselves create new problemsSome of Senges laws most pertinent to our work are 1 todays
problems come from yesterdays solutions 2 behavior grows better
before it grows worse ie benefits of quickfix interventions accrue
in the shorttime only to neutralize and worsen off in the long
run 3 the easy way out usually leads back in 4 the cure can be
worse than the disease ie shortterm improvements can lead to
longterm dependencies 5 cause and effect are not closely related
in time and space and 6 small changes can produce big resultsbut
the areas of highest leverage are often the least obviousWe term these generalizable pitfalls as archetypes This sec
tion will detail some of the broadly applicable system archetypes
and discuss how they might apply to networking in general and
to selfdriving networks in particular These archetypes are easily
understood and once internalized can help designers and stake
holders in identifying the rut they are in and to identify recognizable
paths the leverage points that can adopted for a resolution These
system failure archetypes are listed in Table 2 along with some
networking examples due to the shortage of space these are not
always elaborated upon in text31 Fixes that Backfire
This system archetype is associated with the concept of unintended
consequences Fixes that backfire are characterized by the use of
a quick fix to reduce a problem symptom that works in the short
run but at the cost of longterm consequences which people often
fail to see due to long system delays This is a common pitfall in
networks with some networking examples including 1 increasing
queue buffers to decrease packet loss but instead causing bufferbloat
 and 2 introducing additional links to an existing system only
to see overall performance drop Braess paradox 32 Shifting the Burden
This archetype is associated with the concept of unintended de
pendence This arises from dependence on a quick fix which is
resorted to when the more fundamental solution is too expensive
or too difficult to be implemented This archetype differs from
fixes that backfire since the fundamental solution may not be ap
parent or applicable in the latter With the shifting the burden2Due to the lack of space we omit explanations of these laws and refer interested
readers to On Analyzing SelfDriving NetworksA Systems Thinking ApproachSelfDN 2018 August 24 2018 Budapest Hungary

indefinitely Any engine of growth however successful will in
evitably be constrained by internal and external bottlenecks and
constraints eg Meadows 34 Success to the SuccessfThis archetype is associated with the concept of the winner takes it
all It refers to the common tendency in social systems for the priv
ileged to accumulate more of the benefits than the underprivilegedThis archetype commonly occurs in system dynamics and helps to
make differences in privileges more pronounced over time For the
purpose of selfdriving networks this archetype has implications
for policy making for network neutrality and for ensuring fair re
source allocation For example as major corporations eg Google
Facebook control increasing portions of the Internets content and
infrastructure it seems likely that longterm competition might be
crowded out This would potentially lead to an Internet designed
around the few rather than the many35 Eroding Goals
This archetype also called Drifting goals is another easily recog
nized system archetype It is a special case of shifting the burden
where the preferred quick fix is to repeatedly lower the system goalsThis continuous adjustment then turns out to be fatal for the sys
tem as it fails to fulfill its original design purpose In networks this
sometimes happens in emerging markets where initial deployment
expectations are curtailed by economic considerations 36 Escalation
This system archetype describes the story of unintended prolifer
ation in a sort of an arms race in which the harder you push the
harder the adversary pushes back Many examples can be taken
from network security where the attempts by applications to en
crypt their traffic is responded to by adversaries upskilling their
monitoring technologies eg fingerprinting encrypted webpages37 Tragedy of the Commons
Perhaps the most famous archetype this refers to the concept of a
depleting shared resource that all parties are interested in exploit
ing but none feel responsible for maintaining For networking this
is applicable for unlicensed use of natural shared limited resources
such as radio spectrumeg the problem of interference in un
licensed wireless commons  It was also commonly reported
in peertopeer file sharing applications where users would avoid
sharing upload capacity 4 APPLYING SYSTEMS THINKING INSELFDRIVING NETWORKSIn this section we begin to explore how systems thinking may be
applied to selfdriving networks In particular we propose a system
diagram or systemigram of selfdriving networks in Sectionand discuss various considerations for improving system structure
in Section41 Systemigram of Selfdriving Networks
To illustrate how system thinking concepts may be applied in the
context of selfdriving networks we use a systemigram a port
manteau combining the two words system and diagram shown in
Figure 1 The ultimate goal of systems thinking is to improve the
understanding of systems predicting their behaviors and devising
modifications in order to produce desired effectsThe journey towards this goal starts with understanding the
system structure Oval 1 in Figure 1 which includes recognizing
the interconnects between system components identifying the
feedback between the various entities and identifying all the stake
holders This understanding of the structure will help us understand
the dynamic behaviors of the underlying system OvaThe complex system dynamics can be modeled Oval 3 using
tools such as stock and flow diagrams and behavior over time graphs
 The systems nonlinear behavior can be also understood by
modeling the causeeffect relationship among the variables and
fixed entities in the network system using tools such as causal loop
diagrams System dynamics tool allow us to simulate system models
which can be used to test out the efficiency of various policies or
interventions Oval 4 It is worth noting that selfdriving networks
do not capture a single system but can be thought of as multiple
interacting systems in which one system may be a subsystem of a
larger systemSystems thinking is all about expanding horizons and seeing
the big picture of how the system interacts with other systems
which mutually influence each other Therefore the next stage is
emphasizing an understanding of the system at various scales Ova5 Following these steps will improve our capability of identifying
systems predicting their behaviors identifying relevant systeSelfDN 2018 August 24 2018 Budapest HungaryYaqoob et a
desired effects in selfdriving networks42 Improving System Structure
This section will briefly discuss certain key things that should be
understood when designing selfdriving networks Again we take
inspiration from systems thinking in identifying these considera
tions421 Tussles Conflicts and Dilemmas First it must be kept in
mind that different stakeholders on the Internet ecosystem have
different often conflicting interests which when independently
pursued create tussles of various types For example some people
wish for privacy on the Internet others prefer accountability and
the ability to identify behaviors Some protocols aim to implement
a functionality in an endtoend manner others may prefer an
innetwork mechanism The functionality implemented at various
layers may be neutralized or may even conflict When designing a
selfdriving network we must be clear on which conflicts are being
managed within each design decisionThus there is not a single happy family of people on the Inter
net with aligned goals  Apart from tussles and conflicts Internet
protocols and applications also often face dilemmas in which the
goals of the subsystem and the overall system conflict One of the
major insights of systems thinking is that the best way to optimize
a system is not to independently optimize each subsystem but to
optimize the relationships among the parts which often is the bot
tleneck An important implication for selfdriving networks is that
we cannot be everything to everyoneit becomes important to
clearly articulate our goals while keeping in view that different sub
systems do not have homogeneous interests or pointsofview Wecan also use systems thinking tools to anticipate the nonobvious
interactions between the subsystems and use insights therefrom to
minimize tussles and bottlenecks422 On Architecting Goals for Networks Interventions that aim
to optimize parameters are nowhere as powerful as interventions
that aim at changing the systems goals and paradigms  To
ensure better performance we need clearer articulation of what
the goals of our selfdriving networks are We argue that these
goals should be enshrined in formal declarative languages that are
common across diverse stakeholders Through these it becomes
possible for systems engineers to reason over their design decisionsFor example it makes it possible to identify conflicting goals as
well as key tradeoffs between themFocusing on System Bottlenecks A systems performance
is never the sum of the performance of its parts but the product
of their interactions To improve system performance bottlenecks
should be identified and efforts should be invested in alleviating
these bottlenecks rather than on optimizing subsystems separatelyFor example it is well known that control loops within content
delivery networks and Internet service providers can conflict eg
redirection strategies within a content delivery network may nega
tively impact the load balancing strategies of the network Opti
mizing these two subsystems separately is far less beneficial than
improving their interactions  In addition to identifying the
problematic connections ie bottlenecks selfdriving networks
could also leverage systems thinking to determine new types of
interactions that could mitigate bottlenecks through more efficient
information sharing  Doing so in an integrated way might
address problems faced when deploying past collaborative mecha

timing delays In most networks sharing of information is limited
to standard protocol exchange eg BGP Less conventional data
sharing occurs within a period of days typically manually This
means that relevant information may not be available to the de
cision maker when required This is particularly problematic in
selfdriving which may rely on secondbysecond updates To facil
itate the required timely sharing of information new architectures
and strategies such as split control architectures are needed 5 CHALLENGES IN DEVISING SELFDRIVINGNETWORKSThe previous section has identified key opportunities and ap
proaches to designing selfdriving networks Finally we now look
at key open questions and challenges that remain as ripe areas of
research51 Finding the Right Functional Split
Despite the moniker of selfdriving networks humans will not be
removed completely from the management of networks There wiinevitably be a functional split between humans and computers
for network management It is true that algorithms can prevent
many trivial manual mistakes but it is worth keeping in mind
that algorithms are also not impervious to blunders 52 Ethical Challenges
Giving away the agency of decisionmaking to algorithms in self
driving networks opens up a plethora of ethical challenges Despite
the many successes of machine learning ML experts have pointed
out that many modern ML techniques work like a blackbox and
may make predictions without really knowing why The harm
ful effects of opaque unregulated MLbased algorithms described
by ONeil in The question of agencyie who will take the ethical decision
also looms large for selfdriving networks It is not clear if network
operators and managers should make ethical decisions on behalf of
the uses and if so then how These ethical questions may not have
an objectively straightforward resolution and present dilemmasSelfDN 2018 August 24 2018 Budapest Hungaryeg selfdriving network version of trolley problems The ethical decisions adopted may also have strong social and
economic implications as the policy may be beneficial for some
stakeholders but not for others Furthermore changes in incentives
may trigger changes in the services and products the clients wiuse We believe that systems thinking can allow us to rigorously
study these ripple effects in selfdriving networks Ethical concerns
related to networking research are now being documented and
guiding principles articulated 2 20 but specific ethical concerns
around selfdriving networks require more deliberations53 Security Challenges
As remarked tellingly by Russell Ackoff no problem stays solved in
a dynamic environment Since algorithms are trained using histori
cal datasets selfdriving networks are always vulnerable to future
evolved adversarial attack We argue that we should use systems
thinking tools to anticipate the various kinds of crippling attacks
that adversarial attackers can launch on selfdriving networks Re
lying on algorithmic measures also opens up an opportunity for
malicious applicationsusers to game the system Since selfdriving
networks and adversaries both will be using ML techniques this
will produce an arms race in the network which is related to the
escalation system archetype which can be rigorously modeled using
systems dynamic tools to preemptively discover the unintended
consequences of this adversarial situation6 CONCLUSIONS
Our technological interventions in the Internet have wideranging
implications since Internet technologies are deeply embedded in a
larger social political and cultural context With the rise of interest
in selfdriving networks which will become part of the larger In
ternet there is a need to rigorously look at how these technologies
will affectpositively as well as negativelyall the stakeholders In
order to devise appropriate policies for future selfdriving networks
it is essential that we not only use traditional machine learning
ML and analytic tools but also complement these with systems
thinking tools to study the dynamics of interaction within self
driving networks and between it and other interacting systemsWe believe that system thinking complements traditional methods
eg mathematicalstatisticalML models as well as discreteevent
simulators to bring unique insights not attainable through tradi
tional methodologies Our work applies for the first time powerfinsights from systems thinking and demonstrates their relevance
for studying the broad implications of selfdriving networks Al
though principally applicable to all networks systems thinking
tools are especially relevant for selfdriving networks that wirely on MLbased datadriven algorithms to autonomously drive
networkswhich can suffer from problems such as bias noise and
unintended consequencesto help troubleshoot chronic problems
and to ensure that no significant unintended consequences are
ignored during designAcknowledgments We would like to thank the anonymous

The University of Edinburgh IMDEA Networks Institute Samsung OrangeABSTRACT1 INTRODUCTIONCityscale spatiotemporal mobile network traffic data can support
numerous applications in and beyond networking However op
erators are very reluctant to share their data which is curbing
innovation and research reproducibility To remedy this status quo
we propose SpectraGAN a novel deep generative model that upon
training with realworld network traffic measurements can produce
highfidelity synthetic mobile traffic data for new arbitrary sized
geographical regions over long periods To this end the model only
requires publicly available context information about the target
region such as population census data SpectraGAN is an originaconditional GAN design with the defining feature of generating
spectra of mobile traffic at all locations of the target region based on
their contextual features Evaluations with mobile traffic measure
ment datasets collected by different operators in 13 cities across two
European countries demonstrate that SpectraGAN can synthesize
more dependable traffic than a range of representative baselines
from the literature We also show that synthetic data generated
with SpectraGAN yield similar results to that with real data when
used in applications like radio access network infrastructure power
savings and resource allocation or dynamic population mappingCCS CONCEPTS

developments 34 35 In the networking context spatiotemporamobile traffic is arguably a highly valuable form of data It consists
of information about the timevarying traffic load observed at alocations in a target geographical region A data sample is illustrated

plications are enabled by mobile traffic data that is inherently de
personalized as shown in Figure 1 the data is aggregated over space
eg across all users associated to a same base station or within
a same spatial area and time eg during intervals of minutes to
hours Although its nature poses reduced privacy risks eg as
corroborated by the European Unions General Data Protection
Regulation spatiotemporal mobile traffic data is deemed sensitive
by network operators in terms of industrial and commercial se
crecy Hence access to this data is not uniform and generally scant
in the research community and often occurs behind restrictive Non
Disclosure Agreements NDAs The result is that  the potentiaof mobile traffic data to feed innovation is curbed and  current
research based on mobile traffic is not reproducible or verifiableSynthesis as a solution to data access Motivated by the above
and to overcome the mobile traffic data access barrier we aim at
generating dependable synthetic cityscale spatiotemporal mobile
traffic data Our goal is to design a model trained on a limited
amount of realworld measurement data which can then be used
to generate large amounts of highfidelity synthetic traffic from
publicly available data about arbitrary geographical regionsSuch a model primarily benefits researchers but also data holders
such as network operators By using the trained model researcherCoNEXT 21 December 710 2021 Virtual Event GermanyKai Xu et awould be finally able to independently generate dependable mobile
traffic data to support their studies Ideally this could lead to the
adoption of a reference ensemble of synthetic datasets of spatiotem
poral mobile traffic by the community ensuring the comparability
of results across works based on such type of data In addition data
holders can leverage the model to synthesize and share realistic mo
bile traffic data from their measurements with third parties without
concerns on leakage of commercially sensitive informationChallenges of mobile traffic generation However meeting
the goal above entails a number of significant and unique challengesFirstly generation requires synthesizing spatiotemporal data like
that in Figure 1 without prior knowledge of the historical traffic
in the target area it is thus a different and more complex problem
than eg mobile traffic prediction Secondly ours is a controllable
generation problem the model is required to capture nontriviacorrelations between the urban context and the corresponding mo
bile traffic so as to generate traffic for a previously unseen urban
region solely based on its local contextual conditions Thirdly as
cities have diverse geographical span the model should be capable
of generating traffic over arbitrary spatial dimensions Fourthly
mobile traffic information must cover long time periods to be usefin many applications therefore the model should allow generating
traffic time series of any specified and potentially long duration
without compromising dependability Meeting these last two re
quirements entails capturing complex spatiotemporal dynamics
seen in realworld mobile traffic 47 64 65 so as to preserve eg
traffic peaks and flows across space and time that are rooted in
mobile user movements and digital usagesOur contributions To attain the goal outlined above and ad
dress the associated challenges we propose SpectraGAN a novegenerative model based on a tailored deep neural network architec
ture In essence SpectraGAN is a conditional neural sampler with
two main components an encoder and a generator The role of the
encoder is to transform contextual information that is readily avail
able via public repositories broadly falling into three categories
ie census land use and Points of Interest PoIs so that it can be
used to control of the generation process An example of context
used by our approach is the inhabitant density from population
census portrayed in Figure 1b for the same city of Figure 1aThe generator receives the hidden representation of the context
produced by the encoder and outputs spatiotemporal synthetic traf
fic To this end it leverages the insight that mobile traffic at any
given location exhibits repeating variations over time as observed
in the literature 21 52 72 and in Figure 1c this manifests in the
form of small number of dominant components when traffic is
viewed in the frequency domain as illustrated in Figure 1d Our
generator directly generates the significant frequency components
based on the input context then turns them into a time series via an
inverse Fourier transform as shown in Figure 1e this already weapproximates the actual traffic variations Finally the generator
adds a separately produced contextdriven residual temporal signal
to model smaller fluctuations in traffic as in Figure 1f The pro
cess above is run concurrently and independently on small spatiapatches which are then sewed together to obtain traffic data over
the whole target region SpectraGAN is adversarially trained  la

tions with maximum blue and median red loads whose po
sition is annotated in Figure 1a and Figure 1bd Frequency domain representation of the mobile traffic in acities in our study Orange spectra refer to single locations and

are labelled along the xaxise Data and reconstruction
lines are almost overlaidf Residual signal data minus

leverages a frequency representation of localized traffic to gener
ate mobile traffic for any desired region and temporal duration
given the relevant contextual data 2 This is the first solution to
the important and hard problem of synthesizing spatiotemporamobile traffic from only publicly available information  We evaluate SpectraGAN with multicity mobile traffic mea
surement datasets collected in two European countries 3 Our
results not only justify the design choices for the different com
ponents of SpectraGAN but also show its superior ability in
generating highfidelity longterm traffic for previously unseen
cities relative to representative baseline approaches  We further evaluate SpectraGAN with practical use cases in
networking and beyond and show that using synthetic traffic
data generated with our model yields results comparable to those
obtained with real traffic data Upon publication of this work we will make a synthetic spatiotem
poral mobile traffic dataset generated using SpectraGAN availableSpectraGANCoNEXT 21 December 710 2021 Virtual Event Germanyto the research community Specifically this dataset will consist of
traffic data for five diverse sized cities in Germany obtained with
context data for those cities retrieved from public sources as input
to a pretrained SpectraGAN mode2 SPECTRAGANWe first formalize the problem of synthesizing cityscale spatiotem
poral mobile traffic data then outline our SpectraGAN approach
before presenting the detailed design of its generative mode
in the red circle shifts from one region to a neighboring re
gion over a 2hour period21 OverviewWe start by elaborating on the requirements and challenges that
the target model needs to meet and address211 Requirements and ChallengesGeneration versus prediction Note that traffic generation
task is different from traffic prediction the latter is an active re
search direction in the context of mobile traffic on its own see
eg 73 77 82 Given a sequence of citylevel traffic data snap
shots x1     x over  timesteps and the corresponding context
information c eg population PoIs as input training data the
goal of generation is to model the joint conditional probability
 x1     x  c whereas the goal of prediction is to model the con
ditional probability  x  x 1 c1 While seemingly similar the
former is relatively a much harder task as the distribution is more
complex as apparent when factorizing the joint distribution as
 x1     x  c   x1  c x2  x1 c     x  x1     x 1 cCompared to  x  x 1 c the joint modeling requires to estimate
multiple such conditional probabilities and an extra term  x1  c
which is complex as it is In other words while the prediction in
volves only estimating the local changes from   1 to  generation
demands synthesizing the first point x1 for a given context c and
also estimating multiple consecutive changes towards xControllability An ideal generation method should let users
modify the output synthetic data by specifying certain properties
of the target urban region as context input such as cartography
of urbanization levels and layout of the different city infrastruc
tures Such a controllable generation calls for conditional generative
models rather than just the more common freeform generation
approaches such as those based on vanilla generative adversarianetworks GANsModeling arbitrary spatial sizes In order to work with dif
ferent cities the model should be able to condition generation on
context with arbitrary spatial size This is a known nontrivial task
in machine learning as popular multilayer perceptron MLP or
convolutional neural network CNN architectures only operate on
input with fixed dimensions Recent works try to tackle the problem
in a principled way 10 41 yet no ultimate solution is availableModeling temporal correlations Mobile network traffic ex
hibits a consistent longterm behavior that the generated data should
faithfully reproduce Learning longterm correlations is challeng
ing for recurrent neural networks RNNs where gradients tend
to either vanish or explode in the long term during training While long shortterm memory LSTM 212 Problem Statement The task of conditional spatiotemporamobile network traffic generation is to synthesize traffic data x con
ditioned on context c Formally let us consider a city  whose geo
graphical surface is tessellated according to a regular spatial grid
we term each grid element a pixel and assume that  is covered by
    pixels The cityscale traffic over  timesteps denoted
  is a 3dimensional tensor in R  
     x
1  x
as xThe generation of x
1 is conditioned on ie controlled by the
context for that city denoted as c  R 
 where  is the
number of different types of contextual attributes note that c is a
pure spatial context2 The conditional generation task is to draw

1  for a given length of time   from the conditionadistribution  x1     x   cAlthough the true conditional distribution for city  is not
accessible we can leverage available data from other urban ar
eas Accordingly we take a datadriven approach and design a
parametric probabilistic model with parameters   representing
 x1     x  c and fit the model on training data In par
ticular given groundtruth traffic and context data for  cities
1  c  we fit  on D by finding   that
D  xminimizes the divergence D between data distribution  D and
model   ie    arg min D D   Depending on the specific
training methods different divergence criteria D can be consid
ered Once trained the model can draw samples based on city 
context c to synthesize x1  c1     xImplicit to this formulation is the assumption that the conditionadistribution  x1     x  c relating spatiotemporal traffic pat
terns with context information holds across the  cities employed1 1Although we mention a onestep prediction with a firstorder Markov property here
the argument can be generalized to any horizon and order2The contextual attributes we consider ie census land use PoIs vary over timescales
of months or years which are much longer than those of traffic variations in the
order of minutes In that sense the contextual attributes in our problem setting can be
viewed as static in timeCoNEXT 21 December 710 2021 Virtual Event GermanyKai Xu et afor training and the target city  for which mobile traffic needs to
be generated This assumption is key to the ability of the modeto generalize to unseen cities and is common to most conditionageneration tasks eg 40 49 We verify that the assumption holds
in our mobile traffic datasets through evaluations in 4 Also note
that the above problem and our proposed model outlined beloware general enough that they can support arbitrary units and types
of mobile network traffic These are determined by the nature of
the training data which the synthetic data inherently mimics213 Outline of Proposed Solution At a high level our proposed
solution is to represent  as a conditional neural sampler ie mode as a deep neural network Specifically our conditional neurasampler consists of two major components an encoder EG

processes c into a hidden representation and a generator G that
takes the output of the encoder along with a noise vector z to
output samples x1  We follow the common approach to train
such generative models in an adversarial manner following the
framework of generative adversarial networks GANs  GANs
essentially provide a practical way to match the data and modedistribution as per the JensenShannon divergence  and have
been found to be empirically successful for this purposeOur proposed design of  is guided by the specific requirements
of spatiotemporal mobile traffic data generation as set out in Specifically the neural network model we devise named Spectra
GAN takes the spatial context for a target city and noise as inputs
and directly outputs the frequency components of the signal rep
resenting traffic across the target city over time along with the
residual timeseries signal The rationale for this approach is best
explained by means of an example illustrated in Figure 1 which
refers to the mobile traffic observed over one week in a represen
tative city from our dataset The temporal patterns in the mobile
network traffic in Figure 1c stand out because of the regularity
in the underlying network usage reflecting weekdayweekend di
chotomies circadian rhythms and routines at work commuting or
other daily activitiesSuch periodicities make a frequencydomain representation via
Fourier transformation a compact yet effective way to capture
the usagedependent temporal dynamics Indeed Figure 1d which
shows the traffic timeseries data from each pixel in all cities of
our dataset in the frequency domain highlights how only a few
frequency components appear to be significant across the whole
dataset consistent with observations in prior work eg 21 52 72The effectiveness of a spectrum based design is further proven by
Figure 1e which portrays the mean traffic reconstructed from the
5 significant frequency components the overlap with the originatraffic confirms that the time variation in traffic can be well ap
proximated by considering the significant frequency componentsThe residual traffic in Figure 1f shows the small part of difference
between original and generated traffic which is separately modeled
in SpectraGAN in the time domainIn the light of these considerations a neural sampler that outputs
frequency components can be expected to be especially effective at
modeling mobile traffic dynamics Moreover there are two impor
tant additional advantages with a spectrum based generation First
the approach lends itself to learning relation between context and
traffic data on a perpixel basis this allows capturing the differencesin significance of various frequency components at the pixel level
shown in orange in Figure 1d Second decomposing traffic into
periodic and nonperiodic parts and modeling the former in the
frequency domain and the latter in the temporal domain allows
overcoming the limitations of RNNs mentioned earlier in indeed a spectrum representation naturally adds patterns with
identical periodicity in the same bin and enables a more effective
learning of traffic time series over long time periods The follow
ing subsection details the SpectraGAN architecture while also
explaining how it addresses the other challenges from 211 such
as handling arbitrary spatial sizes22 Detailed Design
Input Specification As directly working on data for arbitrary city sizes poses challenges to neural network design instead
of modeling the entire city traffic map and its dynamics as a whole
our model operates on smaller sized fixed dimensional subregions
of the map which we call traffic patches for every time step Specif
ically each traffic patch x has the spatial dimensions of   
and each context patch c has the spatial dimensions of    We
specifically choose    and     as we experimentally
found that not only the context within the target patch but also that
surrounding the patch correlates with hence allows conditioningits mobile traffic dynamics G222 Generator As illustrated in Figure 3a our conditional neu
ral sampler  has three components an encoder EG
  a spectrum
 and a timeseries generator G

  all of which operate
at the patch leve EG  R   R is a CNN that takes the context
conditions c as input and and outputs a hidden representation
of the context h where  is the number of channels and 
are height and width of each channe  R R   R   is also a CNN that
takes h and noise z as inputs and outputs the traffic in the fre

 Here  is the dimension of the
quency domain denoted as y

Fourier transformation IFFT Note that IFFT is differentiable
so is the overall generator making gradientbased optimization

to generate citylevel mobile traffic data of arbitrary length   for
a target city given its context We now fill the gap between the
patched fixedlength training and this goaTraffic maps of variable spatial sizes At each timestep3 we out
put a set of patches that cover the whole city map and sew them
into a complete map Generating a nonoverlapping set of patches3Note that we omit the time index in the notation throughout this paragraph as the
discussion refers to the procedure for a single timestepff 22222
artifacts at the edge of each patch So we instead take a sliding win
dow approach over space to generate partially overlapping patches
for each timestep As such each pixel in the target city map for a
timestep is generated multiple times as part of different patchesThe final value of a pixel is taken as the average over all values
generated for it More formally for the pixel x  at location  that appears in a set of patches P   x 
1 with  patches the
selected traffic value isx  cidx  Px       where  
  is the corresponding local index of the pixel in each
patch Investigation of more sophisticated methods for aggregating
different estimates for each pixel beyond the average is left for
future work Note that the above averaging step in SpectraGAN
is very different from that in kriging  The core task in kriging
is spatial interpolation ie estimating the value of a pixel from its
neighbors for which there are measurement observations In con
trast we have multiple values generated for each pixel in different
patches where it is part ofIn addition it is worth emphasizing that the randomness should
be shared across spatial dimension when generating patches Oth
erwise the randomness together with the averaging operation in
Equation 2 essentially outputs the expected traffic per pixel lead
ing to oversmoothed traffic maps So we use same noise vector
which models stochasticity and also represents unobserved context
attributes across all patches for the target cityTraffic patch timeseries beyond the training length We can easily
generate arbitrary length signal using G
 by recurrently running a
RNN for the desired number of timesteps within each patch4 Do
ing the same is not as straightforward for G
  which outputs fixed
length frequency components These components are essentially a
discretization of the underlying continuous frequency distribution
the latter is needed to generate time series of any given length We
therefore perform an approximation in the frequency domain in
order to generate longer time series More concretely since the
duration of the time signal obtained via IFFT is linearly propor
tional to the number of frequency components   we can act on the
latter to obtain a time series with target duration   Specifically
for a frequency vector f of length   we first expand f to a desired
length     2  1 If   is a multiple of   our approximation
initializes the newly expanded vector f  with zeroes and then fills
every  location in this vector using values from the old one f
scaled by  so that the total energy is  times see Figure 4 for
an example with   2 This procedure gives f  with the desired
length   and ensures the total energy is also correctly multiplied4We omit the spatial index in this paragraph as it refers to a single patchCoNEXT 21 December 710 2021 Virtual Event GermanyKai Xu et athis produces an approximation of the signal in the time domain
as IFFTf   IFFTf  where f  is the ground truth discretized
frequency domain representation of the targeted length see Ap
pendix C for a justification Such a procedure can be more involved
if   is not a multiple of  as it would require careful smoothing
to avoid potential aliasing with total energy preservation We do
not explore a general approximation in this paper as we are mainly
interested in outputting traffic for multiple weeks3 EVALUATION METHODOLOGYWe evaluate SpectraGAN in 4 using a wide range of fidelity met
rics in comparison with multiple alternative baseline approaches
that reflect the state of the art In 5 we also evaluate the effec
tiveness of synthetic traffic data generated with SpectraGAN to
support diverse application use cases In the rest of this section we
elaborate on the reference datasets metrics and baselines31 Reference DatasetsIn order to assess the performance of SpectraGAN and baselines
we employ realworld mobile traffic data measured in the networks
of operators in two European countries We also gather a variety
of contextual data for the same regions from public sourcesMobile traffic data As our interest is with the generation of
synthetic traffic at urban scale we focus on 13 major cities and
refer to them as City ACity I 9 cities and City 1Citycities in the two countries respectively The data was collected
by the operators using passive measurement probes deployed in
their infrastructure under the control of the local Data Protection
Officers DPOs and in compliance with applicable regulations The
data was aggregated in secure servers at the operators premises
and we only had access to the depersonalized aggregatesThe aggregates report the total mobile data traffic generated
by the whole subscriber base of the operators in the target cities
which accounts for around 30 of the mobile user population in
both countries The data have a homogeneous format across acities as the traffic load is represented over a regular grid tessella
tion of space with each grid element ie pixel covering 250 m2 in all cities the data covers a continuous period of 6 weeks with
a temporal granularity of 15 minutes These settings are aligned
with those of the most popular mobile traffic dataset that is cur
rently publicly available  Clearly as the target cities have a
dissimilar geographical extent the size of their grids is uneven and
spans from 33  33 to 50  48 pixels Traffic volumes in each city
are expressed in bits per pixel and refers to the total uplink plus
downlink demand They are anonymized via normalization by the
pixellevel peak traffic observed in that city Details on character
istics of mobile traffic datasets are presented in Appendix AContext data Our conditional generation model takes advantage
of contextual attributes to produce credible synthetic traffic We
gather a wide range of context data from easily accessible open
sources so that the method is applicable as widely as possible Aattributes are mapped via spatial interpolation or counting to the

insignificant PoI categories using a correlation analysis with traffic
and retain 14 PoI categories in TableIn summary we use 27 different context conditions a subset of
which are exemplified in Figure 5 for one of the cities in our datasetIt is worth noting that no single attribute is strongly correlated
with the mobile traffic as shown in Table 1 This suggests that a
naive univariate statistical model based on any attribute would not
be effective and motivates considering them together as we do in
SpectraGAN As a final consideration we stress that additionarelevant context such as base station locations or radiofrequency
signal propagation maps is not considered since it is typically not
publicly available and difficult to access  which would impair our
intended design of relying solely on easily retrieved context32 MetricsWe use a combination of qualitative and quantitative metrics to
assess fidelity of SpectraGAN relative to the baselines Qualita
tive metrics allow visual inspection of the generated data to check
its unacceptability hence complementing quantitative metricsSpecifically we consider three forms of qualitative assessments SpectraGANCoNEXT 21 December 710 2021 Virtual Event Germanytimeaveraged city traffic maps  timeseries of average citywide
traffic and  traffic videos showing spatiotemporal variationsWe also consider five different quantitative metrics outlinedbelow that cover a wide range of aspects of interestMarginal by total variation MTV This metric quantifies
how well the traffic distribution of generated data matches that of
the real data To compute it we first obtain the empirical marginadistributions of traffic volume across all locations pixels and time
steps for both real and synthetic data Then the metric is calculated
as the total variation TV distance SSIM on average traffic SSIM SSIM Autocorrelation by 1 AC1 This metric also considered
in previous work  is aimed at quantifying the temporal fidelity
of the synthetic data with respect to the real data We compute it
by taking the 1 norm between the corresponding points of the
autocorrelations of real and synthetic timeseries data at the pixelevel Lower values imply better performance as per this metricTrainsynthetictestreal TSTR This metric aims to capture
the quality of generated data through the lens of a generic down
stream use case as done in previous works  We use synthesized
citywide traffic timeseries to train a linear regression model to
predict city traffic snapshot for a future timestep The performance
of the trained model is then evaluated on real data in terms of Frchet video distance FVD  This metric originally de
signed for video data aims at evaluating the quality of spatiotempo
ral data generation By treating cityscale mobile traffic over time
as video data we obtain embeddings of real and synthetic videos
and then compute the Frchet distance between these embeddings
 lower this distance better the quality In the video generation set
ting the embeddings are obtained via a pretrained neural networkHowever using a neural network in our case entails a risk to intro
duce a bias that may artificially favor our model Instead we devise
a strategy tailored to our spatiotemporal mobile traffic generation
setting Specifically we first spatially flatten the spatiotemporatraffic data into a multivariate timeseries We then use a signature
transformation 15 53 to convert the multivariate timeseries into
a vector which we use as the embedding and employ vectors of
the real and synthetic traffic data to compute FVD33 BaselinesTo evaluate SpectraGAN we consider the following baselines that
represent the stateoftheart on mobile traffic generation as weas generic spatial temporal and spatiotemporal data generationFit Distribution and Sample FDaS As later discussed in 7
the current stateoftheart on mobile traffic generation essentially
involve fitting an empirical distribution to model the traffic data
using maximum likelihood estimation of parameters and then sam
ple it afterwards to generate synthetic data While previous works
focus on just the peak hour  or peak and offpeak hours a Weekly traffic generated with FDaS for City A averaged
across the city grey and at two locations with maximum
blue and median red traffic volume as per Figure 1cb City Cc City Dd City H
every hour of the day and sample from those different distributions
to generate citywide spatiotemporal mobile traffic data Like in
 we find lognormal distribution best fits the data but with
different parameters across distributions as expectedPix2Pix From a spatial data generation perspective the Pix2Pix
model DoppelGANger  This is a stateoftheart work on con
ditional timeseries data generation and is based on an RNNbased
conditional GAN architecture As DoppelGANger itself does not
have a spatial dimension we use an independent instance of Dop
pelGANger for each pixel conditioning it on the context attributes
corresponding to that pixeConv3DLSTM As a representative of the start of the art on
spatiotemporal data generation we use a conditional GAN modecombining 3D convolution Conv3D with convolutional LSTM
ConvLSTM  This combination is seen to be an effective choice
for spatiotemporal data generation in the literature 63 83 for tasks
like road traffic flows with Conv3D capturing local spatial dynamics
and ConvLSTM for longterm correlations To realize this modefor our mobile traffic generation task we use the same encoder as
in SpectraGAN to transform the context data to an intermediate
representation that is then fed to the generatorIn addition to the above baselines we also consider an ideal case
for reference which we refer to as Data Metrics for this case are
computed by comparing two distinct 3week periods of real data
against each other and as such is an approximation of the best
achievable values for the different quantitative metrics4 EVALUATION RESULTSIn this section we first evaluate the fidelity and generalizability of
citywide spatiotemporal traffic data generated with SpectraGAN
relative to baselines 33 then we examine the effect of design
choices underlying our approach through an ablation studyCoNEXT 21 December 710 2021 Virtual Event GermanyKai Xu et a41 Overall Generation QualityWe first present the results considering Country 1 dataset and
then for Country 2 dataset Note that the two datasets used are not
mixed in our evaluations rather they are explored in isolation since
they are collected by different operators in different countriesAs we are concerned with cityscale spatiotemporal mobile traffic
data generation we adopt a leaveonecityout evaluation approachEssentially we choose one city as a test city each time and train
each model SpectraGAN and baselines with traffic and associ
ated context data for the remaining cities and repeat this process
with a different test city for all cities We conduct this evaluation
separately for Country 1 dataset with 9 cities and Countrydataset with 4 cities This not only allows us to study the relative
fidelity of different models with respect to the metrics described
in 32 but also lets us assess the generalization ability of different
models to synthesizing mobile traffic for unseen cities This testing
approach is also well aligned with the intended use of SpectraGAN
to generate traffic data for new regions solely from publicly avail
able context for those regions Finally it is worth recalling that the
considered cities have various sizes ranging from 33  33 to 50 pixels therefore the leaveonecityout strategy allows assessing
the capability of the model to generate traffic for arbitrarily sized
areas since the dimension of the training cities and test city may
not be the sameUnless otherwise specified in the following the traffic data is
generated at an hourly granularity to be consistent across all the
methods compared But we remark that SpectraGAN is by de
sign potentially capable of generating more granular traffic data if
equivalently accurate data is available for training as we show later
in Appendix B Concerning the temporal duration of the synthetic
data all models are trained on 1week long data and then made
to generate data for 3weeks different from that in training dataThis lets us evaluate the capability of different models to generate
data for a long period411 Country 1 We start with discussing the fidelity perfor
mance of FDaS baseline Recall that the FDaS method relies on
sampling empirically fitted traffic data distributions at every time
step Figure 6a shows citywide average temporal traffic pattern
generated by FDaS for City A as test city Data generated for two
representative pixels reflecting the maximum and median traffic
pixels in the ground truth are also shown The corresponding reatimeseries traffic pattern is shown in Figure 1c The FDaS gen
erated data fails to preserve the diurnal pattern seen in the readata it is also unable to capture the absolute differences in traffic
volumes across different locationsWe can make the same observation about spatial traffic patterns
with FDaS The timeaveraged traffic maps for City C City D
and City H generated with FDaS are respectively shown in Fig
ures 6b 6c 6d which are in stark contrast to the corresponding
real traffic maps shown in Figure 7 in the row labeled Data The
seemingly random traffic timeseries and maps generated by FDaS
can be attributed to the inherent limitation with this approach to
treat spatial locations and time steps independently thus unable
to capture strong correlations that exist across these dimensionsWhile we find that FDaS can capture the overall citywide traffic
data distributions well as reflected by its MTV results not shown


DataMTV SSIM  AC1  TSTR FVD and expected given its nature the spatiotemporal data generated
is clearly unacceptable from its qualitative results so we do not
consider this method further in our evaluations The above results
with FDaS also support mobile traffic data generation via machine
learning models generally and deep generative models in particular
as we do with SpectraGANWe now consider the quality of generated data with the rest of
the methods including SpectraGAN starting with a visual inspec
tion of the timeaveraged traffic map results in Figure 7 for the
same subset of cities highlighted above We observe that Spectra
GAN shows a good match with real data in capturing the spatiatraffic patterns Pix2Pix captures traffic hotspot areas well but also
shows a strong blur effect highlighting that the image generation
approach is not readily applicable for the mobile traffic generation
case calling for a tailored approach for the latter setting Doppel
GANger shows clear artifacts due to independently generating
traffic timeseries per pixel without regard to correlations among
nearby pixels Conv3DLSTM tends to also generate traffic where
there should be none leading to unsatisfactory spatial qualityWe now switch our attention to examine the temporal aspect
of generated data with the different methods Here we only high
light the generated citywide traffic timeseries results for one city
City B in Figure 8 for a 3week long period5 SpectraGAN yields
temporal traffic pattern that is in close alignment with the readata for the whole period Figure 8a while Pix2Pix as expected
completely fails to model any temporal aspects Figure 8b The
traffic timeseries generated with both DoppelGANger Figure 8cand Conv3DLSTM Figure 8d exhibit deviations from real data
to different degrees We discuss the potential root causes belowTable 2 summarizes the fidelity performance of different methods
in terms of quantitative metrics when considering each city in
Country 1 as a test city and averaging the resulting metric values
across all test cities Here we mark the best worst performing
methods for each metric with green red colors We make the
following observations SpectraGAN yields the best performance
in almost all metrics Even for TSTR it is almost similar to the best
performing method Conv3DLSTM and best possible Datacase These results also demonstrate the generalization ability of
SpectraGAN to new unseen cities Pix2Pix performs the worst
among metrics involving temporal aspects hence also in the traffic
data distribution quantified by MTV But it does well on the
spatial fidelity metric SSIM which is expectedBoth DoppelGANger and Conv3DLSTM yield intermedi
ate results with DoppelGANger performing particularly worse in
terms of spatial fidelity SSIM metric The independent pixellevetimeseries generation approach of DoppelGANger also limits its5We make the full set of results including the traffic videos generated with different
methods accessible via an anonymous repository at SpectraGANCoNEXT 21 December 710 2021 Virtual Event Germanya

in Figure 9a for City B where distribution of the hour of day when
the traffic peak occurs in the generated data with DoppelGANger

rizes the testing performance of different methods in terms of the
quantitative metrics averaged over the 4 cities in Country 2 Note
that we omit FVD in the table due to relatively less amount of
data in Country 2 dataset to get a reliable embedding We also
do not include qualitative results for Country 2 due to space con
straints The relative performance among the methods is broadly
consistent with what is observed with Country 1 dataset Spec
traGAN still emerges as the most reliable model while Pix2Pix is
the least performing one The performance of DoppelGANger and
Conv3DLSTM is in between as before42 Ablation StudyHere we perform ablation study on some key components of Spec
traGAN to justify their choiceImportance of rich contexts We study the importance of using
a wider context scope to generate each traffic pixel via comparing
SpectraGAN to a variant with only pixellevel context as is the
case naturally for DoppelGANger when applied to spatiotemporadata generation Table 4 shows the average performance in terms
of quantitative metrics for Country 1 dataset Results show that
not conditioning on a wide context worsens performance on severaof the metrics with the effect more pronounced for spatial fidelity

show that SpectraGAN needs both the spectrum generator and
the residual timeseries generator in order to perform well across

essentially DoppelGANger with a wider context and explicit loss
in time domain in 3 of the 5 metrics highlights the benefit of our
hybrid spectratimeseries traffic generation5 APPLICATION USE CASESTo complement the previous evaluation we assess the utility of
SpectraGAN through multiple downstream application use cases
for spatiotemporal mobile traffic Specifically we employ synthetic
data generated by SpectraGAN to feed models for  energy
efficient micro Base Station BS sleeping 51 and  resource
allocation in virtualized RANs vRANs 52 We also demonstrate
the benefits of SpectraGAN beyond mobile networking via trafficdriven dynamic urban population tracking It is worth noting that problems   and  above can abe solved effectively only using spatiotemporal mobile traffic data
as shown by recent methods proposed in the literature 42 48
70 They are thus clear examples of situations where researchers
could benefit from the SpectraGANgenerated data to evaluate
models and algorithms that build on such typically hardtoaccessdata While these three use cases cannot cover the full spectrum of
possible problems where mobile traffic data may support a technicasolution they offer a reasonable set of cases that span different
research domains and aspects of mobile network operation51 DataDriven Micro BS SleepingThe substantial operating expense OPEX due to energy consump
tion at BSs has led to the proposal of a number of solutions for saving
power in the RAN We consider a recent approach for trafficaware
BS onoffswitching  and examine how it performs when in
formed with synthetic data generated by SpectraGAN as opposed
to real data We assume a heterogeneous RAN deployment where
each pixel of our spatial tessellation is served by a separate micro
BS whereas macro BSs provide umbrella coverage to a larger area
of 55 grid cells Micro BS provide localized high capacity at added
energy cost and are dynamically switched on and off according to
traffic fluctuations in their associated grid ceThe power needed for the operation of a BS at time  is 0     1   trxwhere trx is the number of radio transceivers 0 is the static
power consumption at zero traffic load  is the scaling of power
consumption per traffic unit   is the relative traffic load at the
considered time  and max is the power consumed at the maximum
traffic load The parameter values for micro and macro BSs are thoseBS type trxMacromax0 BS type trxMicromax0 
of Country 1 when micro BSs are always active and when
a cell sleeping strategy is used based on realworld traffic or
synthetic traffic generated by SpectraGANprovided in the original study in Table 6 Then if    min the
micro BS offloads its local traffic to the macro BS and goes into sleep
mode where it consumes negligible power We set min to 037 as
recommended by previous works  Figure 10 shows that a micro
BS sleeping strategy based on SpectraGANgenerated traffic yields
equivalent energy savings as a model fed with realworld trafficin both cases power consumption reductions due to sleeping are
in the 4762 range with similar variations across the test cities52 Resource Allocation in vRANsEmerging vRAN paradigms foster the creation of edge datacenters
where Central Units CUs execute software part of the function
alities traditionally performed by BSs which are then replaced
by simpler Radio Units RUs The RUtoCU association can be
adapted to the fluctuations of the traffic load at RUs so as to best
use CU resources We investigate the effectiveness of the synthetic
data produced by SpectraGAN in driving a RUtoCU association
model that ensures load balancing across a given set of CUs We assume that each grid cell pixel is covered by one RU and
that all RUs in a city are served by a single edge datacenter hosting
a set of CUs   C The model employs a graph representation
R E of the radio network deployment where each node   R
maps to one RU and each edge    E only exists if RUs  and  
serve spatially adjacent pixels It then formulates the timevarying
RUtoCU deployment as the following optimization problemmincid  E   subject to1   cid    cid30 cid R

                  E   CThe solution of the problem in 3 yields a partitioning of the
graph at time  into C subsets of RUs each associated to one CAs the sum of the RU traffic loads   within a same partition is
equivalent by a tolerance margin  the RUtoCU association is
load balanced in addition it exhibits desirable features in terms of
spatial adjacency and comparable latency across all RUs served by
the same CU  Formally     are decision variables that take
a value one if RU  is associated with CU  at time  and zero oth
erwise They constrain in 6 and 7 the variables     which
indicate whether an edge   is cut by the partitioning and ensure
that each RU is associated to a single CU in 5 The expressions in
4 enforce the load balancing policyWe solve the above problem via an efficient heuristic  using

ity to support adaptive urban and transport planning and mobile
networks are an effective data source for that purpose We stress
that such tracking is completely different from surveying dwelling
units as done in the population census tracking aims at follow
ing orderofminute population density variations whereas census
data only captures home locations Therefore there is no direct
link between the static population data we use as a condition for
generation and the dynamic density we aim at estimating hereWe consider a recent multivariate regression model for the track

original paper and parametrize the constants as per Table 4 in
that same study We generate hourly cartographies of the people
presence in all cities of Country 1 by separately applying 8 to
 the synthetic traffic generated by SpectraGAN on previously
unseen cities and  the actual traffic recorded by the operator
in these cities We then compare the resulting dynamic population
tracking maps in terms of Peak SignaltoNoise Ratio PSNR 
which is a standard metric for image fidelity Table 8 summarizes
the results which highlight the dependability of the synthetic data
for the task at hand across all cities indeed values of PSNR above

ent times of the day for a sample city City Hdeactual measurement data This proves our point that researchers
could use synthetic data generated by our model to demonstrate
the performance of the solutions considered in Sections 5153 in
a way that is both credible due to the similar performance just
mentioned and reproducible as synthetic data can be more easily
shared than realworld data These results pave the way for fur
ther studies considering additional application use cases towards a
complete assessment of the suitability of SpectraGAN as a tool for
the creation of dependable reference spatiotemporal mobile traffic
datasets for the research community6 DISCUSSIONAs the first model of its kind SpectraGAN has limitations that
we deem important to discuss so as to also foster further studies
towards open data synthesis for networking researchFirst there is no universal spatiotemporal granularity of the
mobile traffic data that is relevant and appropriate for all down
stream applications Some studies have indicated that analyses
of several digital human activities are adequately supported by
data with a spatiotemporal resolution of 2 km A setting where the synthetic data currently generated by Spec
traGAN would clearly be illsuited is for studies requiring a higher
spatial or temporal resolution than that considered in this paperThis may be the case of eg network resource management tasks
that operate at fast timescales in the order of seconds In theoryCoNEXT 21 December 710 2021 Virtual Event GermanyKai Xu et a

ments such as those above However we do not presently have
groundtruth data that can be used to verify this hypothesisAs another limitation we would like to clarify that it is not the
purpose of SpectraGAN to model the deeper causes that under
pin the spatiotemporal fluctuations of mobile network traffic such
as the activity or mobility of the users While these phenomena
obviously play a big role in determining the spatial and temporadynamics of mobile traffic in the network explicitly including them
in the generative process is not needed to attain our data synthesis
objective Indeed the SpectraGAN deep neural network architec
ture learns a complex function that translates static context into
realistic spatiotemporal traffic by abstracting various causal pro
cesses in a nonobservable way Therefore if the explicit generation
of the underlying user activity or mobility is required our modeis not an appropriate too7 RELATED WORKNetwork traffic modeling has received substantial attention in the
literature but largely focused on packet level traffic generation via
packet sizes interpacket arrival times Number of traffic gener
ation tools exist for this purpose eg iPerf  DITG  Os
tinato  and such traffic generation capability is embedded in
network simulators like ns3 Our focus is on spatiotemporal mobile network traffic generation
which is an entirely different problem from the ones above Closest
works from the literature to ours by domain are Di Francesco et a Oliveira et al publicly available contextual data to generate traffic in previously
unseen urban regions and is validated extensively with realworld
mobile traffic measurement datasetsMore recently Lin et al  with a similar overall motivation to
ours have proposed DoppelGANger a conditional deep generative
model aimed at network timeseries data which relies on batched
RNN for capturing longterm temporal correlations in data As
DoppelGANger does not have a spatial dimension applying it our
cityscale spatiotemporal mobile network traffic data generation
leads to treating each spatial location independently As a result
DoppelGANger is unable to capture spatial and spatiotemporacorrelations well as we demonstrate in our evaluationsBeyond the networking domain neural networks have been
extensively used for modeling spatiotemporal data Existing archi
tectures focus on next frame prediction in videos by condition
ing them on an image or text sample  videotovideo synthe

crowd forecasting 45 81 84 or learning spatiotemporal feature
representations for prediction problems  While these meth
ods share a similar highlevel goal we target they are not wesuited for mobile network traffic generation Reasons include that
such previous approaches are limited to the estimation of a few
future frames  are conditioned on previous frames  cap
ture only shortterm temporal correlations 44 75 76 and can
be only conditioned on nonspatial contexts such as weather or
weekdaysweekends 45 81 84 In contrast SpectraGAN is de
signed to model spatiotemporal relations over long periods of time
and to condition the generated data on spatial contexts We also
show through our evaluations that a representative model from
this body of literature is not effective for our traffic generation
task highlighting the need for domain appropriate data generation
methods like SpectraGAN8 CONCLUSIONSWe have presented SpectraGAN a new conditional GAN modeSpectraGAN is the first synthetic generation method for cityscale
spatiotemporal mobile network traffic data It embeds a number of
innovative aspects including the defining approach to generate the
significant frequency components of the traffic spectrum for each
spatial location based on local contextual attributes Importantly
the SpectraGAN generation process is conditioned on context data
that is typically publicly available for a city of interest so as to fos
ter its usability We evaluate SpectraGAN using multicity mobile
traffic datasets for two European countries augmented with con
textual data for each city Our results show that SpectraGAN not
only significantly outperforms existing approaches that could be
used for spatiotemporal data generation but is also able to generate
highfidelity longterm mobile traffic data for completely unseen
cities solely based on contextual input We also demonstrate the
efficacy of SpectraGAN through multiple application use cases in
mobile networking and beyondSpectraGANCoNEXT 21 December 710 2021 Virtual Event GermanyACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank the anonymous shepherd and reviewers for their helpfcomments

in emulating the complex dynamics of human communication
that are intrinsic to the physical world  Avatars and virtuacharacters the metaverses inhabitants are often limited in
their capacity to interpret and react to human emotions
social cues and the subtleties of context  As a result
metaverse interactions can lack the depth authenticity and
richness that characterise facetoface encounters leading
to experiences that may feel superficial and disconnectedWhen users engage in the metaverse for specific activities
like business negotiations or personal conversations the
virtual entities insufficient emotional intelligence can lead
to inaccurate perceptions of the users emotional states This
could prevent avatars from providing empathetic responsesto emotions like joy or sadness frustration or anger making
interactions within the metaverse less compelling authentic
and satisfyingThe traditional metaverse is constrained by several limita
tions particularly in terms of personalisation options as
identified in  These constraints inhibit the systems
ability to tailor experiences to individual user needs leading
to possible frustration and diminished engagement This is
of significant concern in domains such as healthcare and
mental health therapy where customisation is vital Tabledelineates these limitations in contrast to the capabilities of
EIM In virtual environments fostering meaningful human
interactions which are fundamental depends on the ability to
establish deep emotional connections which is a challenging
task without emotional intelligence Traditional metaverses
limited by poor content moderation and marketing from
lacking emotional intelligence face negative impacts on user
experience and revenue This issue also perpetuates problems
like hate speech and cyberbullying further damaging user
experience and platform standing To overcome these hurdles
incorporating emotional intelligence into the metaverse and
creating an EIM is imperative The following section delves

dimensioning alone falls short in the evolving metaverse
landscape It lacks emotional intelligence preventing avatars
and virtual environments from effectively responding to
user emotions thus limiting immersion and authenticityThe integration of emotionaintelligence enhances user
engagement empathy and the overall metaverse experience
ultimately contributing to the creation of an EIM For instance
one effective approach involves leveraging users emotionastates inferred from various audiovisual cues during sessions
to optimise resource allocation For example resources for
users expressing negative emotions like anger sadness and

experience D Meditation and Adaptive Health SurgeriesSince the outbreak of COVID19 in 2019 the healthcare
sector has undergone a remarkable transformation embracing
innovations such as telehealth and robotic surgeries  
 Post2020 the adoption of telemedicine skyrocketed
to an impressive 95 up from a mere 43 prepandemic
 The metaverse now emerges as a promising frontier in
healthcare offering telemedicine remote consultations and
immersive health experiences in a dynamic 3D environment
greatly enhancing accessibility and convenience in healthcare
services   This integration within the metaverse
facilitates uninterrupted patient monitoring enables globaexpert consultations and bolsters the security of electronic
healthcare data through blockchain technology  Moreover it empowers precise medical diagnosis through
cuttingedge technologies Metaversebased healthcare enhances humancomputer in
teraction and merges physical and virtual realities It supports
medical education through customised virtual scenarios for
learning without real patient interaction and allows practice
on simulated patients to understand treatments before actuaapplication  For instance authors in limitations especially in healthcare include the absence
of emotional intelligence and the human touch elementWhile it offers impressive technical capabilities it may
struggle to fully replicate the emotional nuances and empathy
that human healthcare providers can offer Patients often
require not just medical treatment but also emotional support
which can be challenging for a purely digital environment
to provide Affective computing can help transform the
traditional metaverse into an EIM bridging the gap between
technical capabilities and the vital human elements required in
healthcare EIM offers a wide range of benefits in healthcare
encompassing realistic and enhanced virtual doctorpatient
interactions and various treatments for phobias By assessing
users affective states personalised therapeutic interventions
can be delivered to enhance patients comfort levels and
sense of presence resulting in significantly positive outcomesFurthermore affective digital entities trained to convey
appropriate emotions can complement clinicians in patient
triage and healthcare interventions Loveys et al advocate
for the use of affective virtual humans in psychological and
behavioural analysis of patients  Virtual humans tailored

practices Additionally EIM can serve as a platform for immersive
virtual therapy sessions where affective computing detects
users emotions and adjusts therapy content in realtime
 This approach provides personalised emotional support
making therapy more effective and accessible For example
cybertherapy adapts itself based on psychophysiologicasignals to reduce stress and anxiety in patients When integrated with patients affective behaviour obtained
through physiological sensors VR can effectively address a
range of phobias In another work Gromala et al utilised
VRenabled mindfulnessbased stress reduction MBSRmeditation techniques for the therapy of chronic pain patients
and showcased the effectiveness of such techniques in
relieving pain when compared to conventional methods E Personalised Gameplay and ContentThe latest advancements in key enabling technologies of

emerged as a game changer for business companies in the
world It enables brands and businesses to extend their reach
and engage their target audience in a more interactive and
entertaining way  It is expected that the metaverse econ
omy would overshoot the realworld economy with overagrowth peaking at 12 trillion  Brands are exploring
the digital realm to capitalise on the business and marketing
opportunities being offered by metaverse  Companies
like Gucci and Walmart have forayed into the metaverse
to provide an immersive experience along with incentive
based interactive games to customers   Jeong

preting human emotions is key to evolving the traditionametaverse into an EIM While its potential is vast realis
ing emotional intelligence in the metaverse faces notable
challenges that require careful attention and resolution for
effective integrationFIGURE 8 Multimodal affective computing where deep learning modelscan be trained using the fusion of multimodal dataA Performance considerations of emotion recognitionAccurately recognising emotions in EIM presents a notable
challenge Variations in facial expressions speech patterns
body language and physiological signals within the EIM canimpact the reliability of emotion detection systems Faciaemotion recognition deemed a prominent facet of emotion
recognition is widely recognised as a crucial component of
EIM  Regrettably computer vision and machinedeep
learning techniques for facial emotion recognition are not
without their inherent limitations The presence of variables
such as lighting conditions facial obstructions head poses
and subtle nuances in expressions impedes the accuracy of
emotion detection in EIM   Moreover culturavariations in the display of emotions introduce additionacomplexities The performance of these visual systems
experiences a significant decline when deployed in real
world environments as opposed to controlled laboratory
settings   Consequently relying solely on faciaexpressions may prove inadequate in understanding the
experienced emotionMoreover identifying emotions conveyed through body lan
guageposture presents a substantial hurdle This necessitates
the use of costly wearable devices and advanced algorithms
capable of discerning movements and subsequently translating
them into the users emotions The need for multiple wearable
devices to accurately capture the movements of various body
parts may pose an inconvenience to users  Additionaconstraints encompass device portability and resource lim
itations such as restricted battery capacity storage and
processing speed  Furthermore the synchronisation of
collected data proves to be a significant challenge especially
in the presence of unreliable network connectivity impacting
realtime emotion recognition Speech signals offer a readily available source that holds
potential for utilisation in EIM for understanding emotions
and adapting accordingly Research communities have made
commendable progress in achieving competitive performance
by developing speakerindependent emotion recognition sys
tems Nonetheless achieving languageinvariant emotion
detection remains a significant hurdle  Despite emotions
being deemed language invariant the efficacy of emotion
recognition wanes when assessed across diverse language
emotional corpora To address this concern the conceptVOLUME of leveraging representations derived from fewshot learn
ing emerges as a potential strategy for adapting emotion
recognition systems  This approach necessitates a
limited number of samples from the target language datasetNevertheless the existing corpora cover only a small fraction
of the worlds languages in stark contrast to the multitude
of languages spoken globally To rectify the limitations observed in vision body language
and speechbased emotion recognition systems scholarly
literature proposes the adoption of multimodal approaches
 These approaches advocate for the simultaneous
analysis of video and audio inputs harnessing the powerfsynergy between facial displays and paralinguistic speech
features By incorporating both modalities as shown in
Figure 8 a more resilient and accurate emotion recognition
system can be achieved particularly when confronted with
intricate or amalgamated emotions in realworld scenariosThis multimodal strategy enriches the emotional context by
surpassing the confines of a solitary input type thereby
enhancing the overall efficacy of the recognition process
B Securing EIM Against Adversarial AttacksResearch has shown challenges in designing robust affec
tive computing systems due to adversarial examples which
demonstrate deep model vulnerability to imperceptible pertur
bations   Prominent attacks craft perturbation noise
guided by targeted output gradients including fast gradient
sign method  Jacobianbased saliency map attack 
and DeepFool  Affective computing systems are also
susceptible to such attacks   Attack success
underscores lack of robustness in DL model representationsAs described by Li et al  they proposed a robust
detectiondeactivation method for adversaries in EIM Their
method can restrict and separate access of potential malicious
participants meaning it can block vulnerable backpropagation
and GAN attacks The motivation was drawn from anomaly
detection systems Though presenting a potential solution
an adaptive adversary can learn this behaviour and modify
attack vectors to inject EIM model vulnerabilities This
shows adversarial attacks significantly threaten affective
computing in EIM Malicious actors can manipulate input
to deceive emotion models enabling incorrect responses or
unauthorised access to sensitive user emotions Attacks can
undermine trust compromise privacy and enable harm To
counter susceptibility training DL models to generate robust
representations against transformations has been explored
  Notably very deep architectures demonstrated
SER robustness Yet further exploration is needed into
what DL models capture from speech and how to define
adversarial examples without adversary knowledge This
will help develop robust defences tailored for EIM using
techniques like adversarial training anomaly detection and
ensembling  C Privacy and Security Considerations in EIMEIM draws upon various data sources from diverse sensors
cameras microphones etc Assuring the privacy and security
of users emotional data is paramount requiring robust encryp
tion secure data handling and user consent mechanisms Emotion tracking inference of private state surveillance data
leakage data manipulation lack of control over automatic
inference identifying despite anonymity etc are a few data
privacy challenges that require immediate attention Research should focus on developing robust encryption
techniques usercontrolled datasharing mechanisms and
secure storage practices to address privacy and security
concerns of affective computing in EIM While the literature has indeed touched upon privacy
challenges in the metaverse as evidenced by notable works
such as  it is important to acknowledge that
the introduction of affective computing exacerbates the
privacy predicament Therefore it is imperative that we
closely examine the unique issues that arise when affective
computing is integrated into EIM as this intersection presents
heightened privacy challenges that warrant diligent attention
and understanding Indeed while there have been some
endeavours to comprehend the challenges surrounding the rise
of privacy issues of utilising affective computing component
techniques in the metaverse    it is worth noting
that the empirical testing and validation of these issues are
relatively scarce in the existing literatureD Addressing the Uncanny Valley Phenomenon in EIMCreating an authentic and natural interaction involving
affective computing within virtual environments while avoid
ing the uncanny valley phenomenon necessitates a delicate
balance between preserving authenticity and ensuring user
comfort  The uncanny valley effect occurs when avatars
possessing humanlike attributes exhibit subtle deviations
that evoke a sense of unease among users  To address
this challenge a comprehensive exploration of strategies is
imperative encompassing not only the enhancement of avatar
design and animation but also the optimisation of emotionarepresentation Transcending the uncanny valley requires
researchers to delve into refining avatar design aiming to
achieve a closer resemblance to humans while still being
wellreceived by users  This may involve meticulous
adjustments to facial features body proportions attire and
other visual elements  Furthermore investigating inno
vative animation techniques that emulate human movement
patterns can contribute to a more genuine and lifelike user
experience Additionally the concept of portraying emotions plays a
pivotal role in tackling the uncanny valley issue Techniques
that accurately capture and convey emotional states through
avatars facial expressions gestures and vocal nuances
can significantly heighten emotional authenticity  The
integration of algorithms for emotion recognition and real
time adaptation empowers avatars to respond appropriately to
users emotional cues establishing a deeper connection andVOLUME OJ Logomitigating any potential discomfort Achieving a harmonious
synthesis among the intricate facets of avatar design anima
tion and emotional representation is a multifaceted endeavourResearch endeavours should be focused on unravelling the
intricacies of the uncanny valley while embracing novetechnologies to cultivate emotionally resonant interactions
that are both immersive and comfortable for users Through a
systematic exploration of these methodologies the foundation
can be laid for enriched and emotionally fulfilling interactions
in EIME Modelling Dynamic and Evolving Emotional States inEIM
The EIM offers longterm interactions and experiences
leading to dynamic shifts in users emotional states over
time Affective computing models in EIM need to adapt
to these changing emotional dynamics to maintain accurate
recognition and response Ensuring that the system adapts
without causing user discomfort due to sudden emotionachanges or failing to recognise gradual shifts presents a
significant challenge In order for EIM to thrive it is paramount to design stochas
tic models for continuously evolving emotional states and
dynamics The nonstationarity and longcontext dependence
inherent in emotional expressions pose significant challenges
when it comes to modelling and interpretation Traditionaapproaches may struggle to capture the intricate nuances
and the evolving relationship between different modalities
used to convey various emotions over time in EIM To address these complexities a multimodel integrated
solution is necessary Such a solution should be capable of
understanding and incorporating the nuances and dynamics of
emotional expressions within EIM   By integrating
multiple models that account for various modalities including
facial expressions body language voice tone and other
contextual cues we can strive for a more comprehensive and
accurate understanding of users emotions  Furthermore
this integrated solution should be designed to capture the
temporal aspect of emotional expressions recognising how
emotions evolve and change over time By considering the
historical context and the progression of emotional states we
can develop a more nuanced understanding of the emotionalandscape within the metaverse F Challenges of Realtime Emotion Processing in EIMAffective computing in the EIM requires realtime process
ing to provide seamless and responsive emotional interactionsHowever achieving lowlatency emotion recognition and
generation poses technical challenges especially in resource
constrained environments Federated computing architecture
can optimise the overall efficiency and effectiveness of
data analysis in EIM When it comes to EIM addressing
communication issues and network latency becomes even
more critical The nature of shortlived and rapidly changing
emotional states necessitates an extremely low latency for
accurate and realtime processing To date providing real
time processing and low latency for affective computing
applications in the EIM remains an open question that requires
further exploration Tang et al This section highlights key areas requiring attention for
EIMs successful implementation and its related technologiesThese future directions are crucial in developing a robust and
ethically guided framework for EIMA Foundational Models and EIMThe recent convergence of large language models and
large audio models with the capabilities of 6G technology
is ushering in a new era of realtime interactions These
models such as GPT4 Reinforcement Learning

enable more natural and empathetic interactions to unfold
seamlessly over extended periods within the EIM Addition
ally its imperative to recognise the influence of cultural and
contextual variations on emotional expressions Emotions
are expressed differently across cultures and within various
contexts potentially leading to misinterpretations by models
that lack exposure to diverse data To mitigate this challenge

emotional predictions Current affective computing systems
often lack clarity and userfriendliness resulting in outputs
that are difficult for people to make sense of Improving
transparency in AI models emerges as a potential solutionModel transparency involves clarifying how the system
reached a decision  While decision tree models
are naturally transparent black box models require extra
tools to explain them  Elaborate models may capture
emotions in intricate ways hindering straightforward human
comprehension and complicating the validation of accuracy
and fairness Recently explanation tools have emerged
providing users with insights into how systems make decisions
  Upcoming research should focus on techniques
to create understandable emotional representations in affective
computing models This might encompass visualisations
attribution methods or embeddings that shed light on how
models capture and use emotionsD Ethical and social considerations in developingapplications for EIM
EIM holds the potential to reshape industries human inter
actions and address global challenges while promoting equaopportunities However it also presents complex ethical and
social considerations that necessitate careful navigation 
 As affective computing applications in EIM gather and
analyse user emotional data it is crucial to obtain informed
consent and address ethical concerns  Users must be
empowered with control over the collection and use of their
emotional data while simultaneously ensuring transparent
communication of potential risks associated with emotionainsights   Since affective computing techniques
for EIM are still in their early stages of development it is
crucial to address the ethical challenges before rolling out
applications that rely on these technologies FIGURE 9 Reinforcement learning from human feedback RLHF which

outstanding performance is its training method known as
reinforcement learning from human feedback RLHF as
shown in Figure 9 The principles of RLHF could be explored
within EIM to enhance emotional modelling fostering more
empathetic and contextaware virtual interactionsVOLUME OJ LogoThe integration of real and virtual economies in EIM
brings forth risks encompassing security fraud scams and
instability  It is equally important to contemplate the
impact of EIM on health and wellbeing as prolonged
immersion in virtual realms can give rise to addiction
or isolation  Moreover the absence of moderation
and the existence of illegal content only serves to amplify
doubts regarding trustworthiness  The decentralised and
occasionally unregulated nature of metaverse activities creates
opportunities for misconduct and exploitation  The fundamental challenges hindering the realisation of EIMs
full potential stem from the absence of ethical and sociaconsiderations within the broader technology landscape As EIM involves capturing human emotional states through
various sensors the entrenched lack of ethical and socially
conscious algorithm and product design presents a daunting
challenge that demands immediate attention  Rosenbergs research Social norms could act to limit the development and
implementation of affective computing applications in EIM
 For instance most societies have strong norms around
privacy especially concerning sensitive personal data such
as emotions  Constantly monitoring users emotions
could also be perceived as odd invasive or creepy by
some going against social expectations of normal human
interaction and potentially limiting adoption  Certain contexts may also have clearer guidelines around the
appropriate use of these technologies compared to others 
for example work education or healthcare versus leisure
contexts  Displays and interpretations of emotion also
vary significantly between cultures so EIM applications
would need to be sensitive to cultural norms to avoid offence
or misunderstanding While ethical challenges in affective computing have
received attention the specific ethical implications of ap
plying affective computing in EIM remain an underexplored
area    A brief summary of challenges in
developing EIM are also provided in Table 8 This entails

emotional insights in the metaverseVI ConclusionsIn this paper we explore how affective computing enhances
the traditional metaverse creating an emotionally intelligent
metaverse EIM which redefines user interactions with virtuaenvironments and AI entities for richer experiences impacting
domains like healthcare and entertainment A brief summary
of EIM features and potentials is presented as follows EIM enables avatars and digital counterparts to adapt

images and multiple platforms WhatsApp and TwitterWe begin our investigation by analyzing the content shared
in the WhatsApp groups and filtering out the COVIDrelated content The filtered content is then further divided
related categoriesinto text
Using this data we make the following contributionsimages videos and other We offer the first WhatsApp dataset consisting of
discussions related to COVID19 from Pakistan The

includes texts images and videos originating
from 227 groups The anonymized dataset will be
made publicly available to the community We show using extensive manuaannotation that
around 14 of the messages related to COVID19 had
misinformation about the pandemic We perform a temporal analysis of misinformation

EII R ELATED W OR KC Our Vorks NoveltyA Misnj ormation on VhatsAppWh atsApp h as been a source of major political misinformation and propaganda campaigns   Political part ies
h ave invested he avily in social media str ategies by creating
Wh atsApp groups to reach WhatsApp user s  Surv eys
done in India and Brazil show that at least one m SIX use rs
are part of one such public political WhatsApp group

  Particul arly Resende et al B Health Misnjo rmationA maj or focus of this paper is understandi ng the spread
of health misinformation re lated to COVID 19 Wh atsApp
has been a major source of health misinformation espec ially
during the p andemic  17 This misinformation ranges from
highlighting wrong sympto ms to ineffective treatm ents  in
reported a massive wave of misinformation
et aon social medi a espec ially on Twitter during the Ebola
pandemic in Africa More comprehensie detais n ho
fake news about Ebola on social media applications IS
explored in  19With the ongoing surge in the COVID 19 pandemic a
wealth of misinformati on has already been documentedSharma et ato study itit is import antTo the best of our know ledge there does not exist any
work analyzin g COVID3 related discussions on Wh atsAp pSince Wh atsApp is arguably the most frequ ently used application in the world

how people are using the platform during the pandemic
and how the platform facilitates the sprea d of COVID19 misinformation Althou gh prior work has focused on
misinform ation spread via WhatsApp in Brazil and India
we are the first one to study misinformati on on Wh atsApp
during a maj or pandemic Furthermore our analysis is
focused on Pak istan  which has a thriving M uslim relig ious
identity which allows us to see how religion plays a role
in the context of publi c health  In contrast to the majority
of prior work on misinform ation which focuse s on textuaanalysis we also provide a deta iled ana lysis of images
related to COVID 19 and study the information spread
across Wh atsApp and Twitter both for text messages as weas imagesIII METHODOLOGYIn this section we delineate our data collection  annotation method ology and discuss the related ethical issuesA Daza CollectionWh atsApp allows its users to cre ate public and private
groups The pub lic groups can be j oined by any user of
the platform typically through an invite URL of the form
chatwhats appcom  These URLs are frequently sh ared via
other soci al web platforms eg Facebook Twitter to invite
third p arties to joinSelection of groups  To compi le a list of relevant public
groups  we looked for ch atwhatsappcom links on Facebook
and Google to find group invite URLs We specifically
targeted the popular political partie s of Pakistan as these
groups tend to be mor e active and give an idea of the
political sphere Hence  Wh atsApp along with politicapartie s n ames and slogans were used to search for public
groupsBased on the above parameters  we compi led a list of
282 pub lic Wh atsApp groups  In ord er to ensure the quality
of groups we manu ally discarded groups that were umelated  For instance if a groups profile picture group name
or bio did not contain any relevant
information politicaaimsmo tivations then it was remov ed We further removed
groups which were buying and selling thins and did not
have any organic interactions messages ThIS left us WIth
227 public groups on which the analysis was doneIn order to find these groups a set of queries search
engines and filters were used These queries can be found
at  We also plan to release our
anonymised dataset once the p aper is accepted to encourage
further research on Wh atsApp dat a from PakistanWhatsApp data coll ection To jo in and get data from the
groups we used tools provided by Garimella et al  10
which uses the Selenium Web Driver to autom ate the Jommg
of the groups What sApp stores all message dat a on the
users device in an encrypted SQ Lite datab ase We used
a rooted Android dev ice to obtain the decryption key and3For brevity we refer to COVID19 simply as COVID and use theseterms interchangably  Restrictions applyand extracted the decrypted database every week The media
content which is stored as encrypted URLs was downloaded
locally and decrypted using a public tool slightly modified
for our convenience WhatsApp deletes media content from
their servers after a certain amount of time As a result
when decrypting media files we missed a small subset of
the content shared 14 The joining of the groups took
place over a 1 month period as new groups were being
identified The data collection started from 10 Januaryonward and continued until 23 February 2020 We have
complete data from all groups from the end of February
until the second week of April The details of the dataset
are summarized in TableTable I Overview of our WhatsApp datasetliroups

25Twitter data To compare the data we obtained from the
WhatsApp groups to other open well studied social media
platforms we also gathered data from Twitter Specifically we obtained historical Twitter data on an extensive
list of hashtags specific to COVID19 in Pakistan such
as CovidPakistan CoronaFreePakistan5 and other locaTwitter trend variations This gave us 800000 tweetsEthics note The groups joined had been openly propagated on Facebook  Twitter and other mediums and can
be joined by anyone The profile bio of our WhatsApp
account declares that we are collecting information for
research purposes We also anonymized the user data before
analyzing itB Identifying COVID19 Text MessagesWe extract COVID19 related text messages using a
keywordfiltering approach We utilize  which offers
a dictionary of COVID19 English keywords We added
small variations and multiple spellings to the dictionary to
capture a wide variety of content related to the pandemicWe translated these keywords into Urdu and used both
the English and Urdu keywords to search our dataset The
final list includes keywords such as corona coronavirus
covidIv covid covidlv and corona virus among
others This keyword based approach results in a high
precision yet low recall method to identify COVID related
messages Using this approach we obtained 5039 COVID
related text messages between March 16 2020 and Apri09 2020 Figure 1 compares the number of daily COVID19 related and NonCOVID19 related text messages in our

5 1 COVID vs NonCOVID texts Timeline of number of messages and messages containing COVID related
keywords in our WhatsApp datasetC Identifying COVID19 ImagesAs we see in Table I around 25 of the content

images Hence solely evaluating text would give a distorted
view of the overall information landscape Naturally image
content is far harder to automatically categorize Therefore
to extract images discussing COVID19 manual tagging was
performedTwo armotators tagged a total of 6699 images ranging
from 16 March to 9 April 2020 An image was declared as
COVID related if it had any of the following attributes1 Contained Coronavirus COVID19 or any other related terminology in Urdu or EnglishInformation relating to a lockdown or any restrictions
being imposedrelaxed by the government on business
or publicprivate institutions3 Sharing of any precautionary measures like prayers
for protection from disease herbal medications etc4 Contained any references to the environmental oreconomic impact of COVID5 Contained people with personal protective equipment
possible quarantine centers and people practicing or
encouraging social distancingAn inter annotator agreement score of 98 was observedIn cases of a conflict
the annotators were allowed to
mutually discuss and agree upon a label A total of 2345 images were identified as COVID related while
4390 65 were identified as nonCOVID images For
context Figure 2 shows the percentage of COVID related

to understand what types of COYID related information is
being shared on WhatsApp We first armotate the data into
5 overalapping categories and then use these categories to
understand the types of informationA Message Type CategorizationIn order to further characterize the types of COYIDrelated content being shared within our WhatsApp groups
we categorized the COYID related text and images manually into the five categories Information Misinformation
JokesSatire Religious and Ambiguous The categories were
chosen based on a preliminary manual exploration of the
COYID19 content The categories are not mutually excsive and as a result a single message textimage can belong
to multiple categories We describe each category belowin the Poynter dataset1 Information This category consists of WhatsApp
content that contains either factual News or COYID
related facts News reports are fact checked using
Poynters COYID Facts database  which contains aof the falsehoods detected by a large number of fact
In addition AFP Pakistan
checking organizationsFact Check is used to verify news articles The
contents of the text or image are evaluated against
the falsehoods in the database to verify their validityGoogle search was also used to verify certain claims
If the news is

reported by a reputed news source then it is labelled
as Information A news source is considered reputed
if it has a satellite news channel or newspaper at a
national level COYID related facts are verified using
WHOs COYID Information and pervalent myths2 Misinformation This category is the inverse of the
above Information category Any content which is
either verified to be misinformation or could not
be verified as credible information is placed in this
category Content was checked using Poynter COYIDFacts and Falsehoods database AFP Pakistan and
WHOs COYID Informations and COYID Myths3 JokesSatire This class consists of content thatintends to poke fun at the COYID19 pandemic itself or
any COYID related governmentpolitical actions using
sarcasm satire or memes It also contains content that
consists of nonfactual opinionsanalysis regarding
current COVID related events or government actions4 Religious Since Pakistan has a 98 Muslim poplation religion plays an important role in information
dissemination A religious theme in content is identified by looking for i references to spiritual texts iiquotes of religious scholars called Maulana Mufti
or Sheikh and iii mentions of religious acts such as
prayer fasting etc5 Ambiguous If the content does not have enough
information to be classified into one or more of the
is then assigned to the Amabove categories
biguous category This category mainly consists ofit6hUps

nation requests etcReligiousJokeSatire1 7 2191 6 Ambigous l1li 1 0 15 Images Texts
 TextsImagesMessages
texts Medium Green and texts  images Dark Green for
each category Notably 14 of the total messages were
labeled to be misinformationNote that to maintain consistency in annotation quality
between images and text images were annotated by two
annotators whereas text was done by only one annotator
we randomly sampled 25 of the 5039 COYID19 related
texts and validated the annotation We showed the 25
random sample of messages to one additional annotator
and measured the agreement with the original annotatorWe find an 82 agreement between the two annotators
with one or more common labels counted as an agreement
for our nonmutually exclusive classes The majority of
disagreements were between Information  okesS atire and
Religious classes This is because a lot of texts contain
different proportions of the three Very few disagreements
were observed when one of the annotators tagged a text
as Misinformation which were resolved after a discussion
between the two annotatorsB Message Type AnalysisWe now analyze the different types of COYID19 related
content in both texts and images on WhatsApp based on the
above annotation We have a total of 5039 texts and 2images which discuss COVID related information between
March 16 and April 9 2020 The overall distribution of texts
and images into the COYID19 related content categories
are shown in Figure 3 A majority of the content is simple
information 29 containing news articles latest government actions and health information related to COYID19 This is followed by religious content 25 The large
amount of religious content emphasizes the importance of
religious sentiment within the society especially during
times of uncertainty created by the pandemic Religious
scholars and Holy Verses from religious books were cited in
these messages Religious content was also event focusedFor
instance a ban on congregational prayers and the
rigorous COYID testing of a group of religious people on
a proselytising trip resulted in messages criticising these
government actionsThis was followed by JokesSatire representing 17 of
the messages Political actions by rival parties and government officials were frequently ridiculed and mocked
including personally targeted attacks For instance many  Restrictions applyof such texts were against government action of opening
the border with Iran blaming the officials for bringing
Interestingly a non trivial amount
Corona to Pakistan14 was Misinformation which shows that one in seven
messages shared contained some misleading informationThis included fake news reporting deaths of politicians fake
quotes from famous personalities and international figures
or fake COVID origin stories We show detailed analysis of
misinformation in Section VFinally a small fraction of messages 12 were labelled
Ambigious Among these a significant portion of texts
contained Facebook and YouTube followsubscribe requests
to COVID related pages and channels donation requests or
shared contact information for COVIDaffected and povertystricken people We also found some images depicting
quarantine centers hospitals doctors and patients which
did not fit into the above categories due to the lack of
contextC Lifetime of MessagesIn this section we try to understand the impact of the
various types of COVID messages on WhatsApp To do
so we analyzed the lifetime of various types of COVID
related messages The lifetime of a message is the difference
between the last and first appearance of a message in
hours in our dataset First we grouped together perceptually
similar images using a popular state of the art image hashing
tool from Facebook known as PDQ hashing The hashes
were generated for all the COVID related images and then
instances of similar images were clustered together by using
Hamming distance with a threshold of 70 between the
hashes The difference between first and last appearance of
a representative image in each cluster was considered as the
lifetime of that image For texts exact string matching was
used to find the first and last appearance of a text Table
II shows the mean lifetime of messages belonging to the
various COVID19 content categoriesEach category exhibits distinct mean and variance measure for lifetime The most short lived messages belong to
the JokesiS atire category This appears logically coherent
since jokes opinions and satirical texts are generally dictated
by events and die out quickly as the public focus shifts from
one event to another Interestingly the lifetime of a message
containing misinformation is quite high for both text 7 hrsand images 55 hrs especially compared to the Information
category This means that misinformation tends to persist
longer compared to information which supports existing
studies showing similar results   Given that WhatsApp is a closed platform with no content moderation or
third party fact checking the fact that misinformation tends
to stick around longer might be expected but might also be
problematic when compared to other social networks where
eventually corrections can be issuedV RQ2 COVID19 MISINFORMATIONIn this section we specifically look at misinformation
posts and characterize the types of misinformation shared
on WhatsApp We first categorize the types of misinformation based on reports from popular fact checking
organizations and then base our characterization on this
categorization9 II Lifetimes of COVID19 related texts and images

COVID19 related misinformationFake News The most frequent
form of COVID related
misinformation is in the form of fake news with 45 of
misinformation texts This includes fake news pertaining to
COVID positive tests and COVID related deaths of world
figures such as Ivanka Trump Prince Williams and even the
current Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan Conspiracy
theories about Bill Gates intending to place RFID chips in
people to track COVID19 were also seen Ironically fake
news were also observed regarding a doctored government
action announcing Punishment for Spreading Fake News
on social mediaFake Origins The second most prevalent form of COVID19 related misinformation is claiming fake origin stories
for the virus with 22 of the misinformation texts Fake
origin stores include a Corona named lake in Kazakhstan
from which the virus came to being grown in a lab in  Restrictions applyChina or United States A few Hollywood movies namely
Contagion Resident Evil and I am Legend along with
the book The Eye of Darkness were frequently mentioned
stating that COVID19 had been predicted by themFake Remedies Making up roughly 20 of the misinformation this type contains bogus remedies and treatments
such as the lminute breath hold test to detect COVID and
various items like basil seeds gargling with salt or garlic
water honey lemon tea and even HepatitisC medicine as
cures to COVIDVaccine Myths The fake origin stories were sometimes
accompanied with claims of the vaccine already being developed and being used as an economic leverage Countries
such as Israel China and United States were mentioned
with claims of the vaccine already developed This category
makes up around 6 of the misinformation textsWeather Myths Four percent of the misinformation claims
that the virus can not survive in winter summer or rainy
seasons and the outbreak would die down on its ownFlu Comparison Only 2 of the misinformation attempted
to downplay the symptoms and severity of the disease
by comparison to the common seasonal flu Even though
this narrative was popular elsewhere eg US it did not
have much salience in Pakistan with the general public
acknowledging COVID19 as a distinct and more dangerous
disease as compared to the common fB Lifetime of MisinformationThe temporal properties ofthe various categories of
misinformation are analyzed in table III For each message
we compute the lifetime as the difference between its last
and first occurance The Fake News category has the
shortest lifespan as evidenced by the lowest mean of 4 hrsThis seems to be consistent with the hypothesis that event
triggered content is shortlived with similar properties to the
JokesSatire category of COVID19 related textual contentThe highest
lifespan is for the Fake Remedies category
with a mean life of 10 hrs which is significantly larger
than other major categories This indicates that content that
is not tethered to a social event is more likely to being in
circulation on a social media platform like WhatsAppTable III Lifetime of misinformation texts shared on WhatsAppLaberake News

content is being shared Only 37 users exclusively shared
misinformation whereas 67 users shared a mix of content
along with misinformationTo further understand if there is disinformation we tried
to see if a specific type of image is being spread more
than others Using the clusters we already had made via
PDQ hashing and Hamming distance clusters having misinformation were identified The number of images within
these clusters are a good indicator of the impact of given
misinformation on the network 23 unique images were
shared more than 1 times and only 8 were shared more
than 5 timesThis implies that even if we consider the images shared
multiple times to be disinformation the quantity of disinformation is very low Hence we believe the misinformation
is rather than being an organized effort is mainly being
spread due to lack of awarenessVII RQ4 CROSS NETWORK INFORMATION SPREAD
Finally we answer how information flows between WhatsApp and Twitter Given that each social network has
different properties closed vs open affordances egthe
ability to see how popular a content
is with retweetlike
count and user bases such a comparison is interestingA MethodologyTwitter was chosen as most of Twitter data is public
and it serves as one of the major information conduits We
obtained more than 08 million unique tweets starting from
January 10 to April 9 using an exhaustive list of hashtags
related to COVID19 in Pakistan It must be noted that both
Twitter and WhatsApp datasets only represent a subset of
the actual activity and in no way can be thought to represent
the full networks behaviour Iu order to understand the flow
of information images and text present within WhatsApp
from 16 March to 9 April 2020 were compared with tweets
in the same time range To find similar content across Twitter
and WhatsApp PDQ hashing was used for images and fuzzy
string matching was used for text messagesB Cross Platform Image SpreadTo understand how images were propagated across networks we isolate the tweets containing image content from
the Twitter dataset This covers a total of 67119 images We
then generate PDQ hashes for both WhatsApp and Twitter
images and matching two images if their hashes have a
Hamming distance of 40 default value suggested by PDQAround 1500 similar images were found common to both
WhatsApp and Twitter within the date range of interestMarch and 9 April Out of these 1500 images 541 were
COVID19 relatedTable IV breaks down the images into the categories previously described alongside the average number of retweets
replies and the lifetime of the image difference between
first and last appearance of an image on Twitter Firstly
we observe that the largest category of images shared across
both Twitter and WhatsApp is that of misinformation 29We can also see that misinformation tweets have a high
average number of retweets potentially reaching tens of
thousands of users This is signal in Twitter or other socia Religious

as seen on Twitter Twitter tends to hold a message alive for
a coupe of days A healthy trend is that Information tends
to live the longest on Twitternetworks which does not exist on WhatsApp where the
social popularity signals like retweet or like counts are
shownCompared to the other categories misinformation on
Twitter tends to die quicker Figure 8 shows a CDF of
the lifespan of the various categories of images on TwitterWe see that most
types last at most a day with most
having a long tail lasting weeks This is very different from
the pattern we observed on WhatsApp where on average

images lasted only a few hours Images containing
information have a much higher lifetime which is also in
stark contrast to what we observed on WhatsAppThe difference in longevity of a message as seen in
Table II and IV points towards the nature of interactionsInteractions on WhatsApp are immediate as new messages
constantly replace old ones Whereas on Twitter old tweets
can be easily brought back into limelight using retweets
comments and likes by influential people Hence the ability
of Twitter to keep conversation around a tweet alive for a
long time could be the reason for the overall life of COVID
tweets in days compared to WhatsApp in hoursTable IV Characteristics of images mapped between Twitter

across WhatsApp and Twitter is shown in Figure 9 The
Figure also provides three example case studies of images
which originated on WhatsApp and went on to become

timelines of images observed on both platforms we can
conclude that most of the images are seen originating from
WhatsApp and then appearing on Twitter in our datasetOn average an image appears on WhatsApp 4 days earlier as
compared to Twitter As a result in light of the data analyzed
it can be concluded that WhatsApp plays a critical role
in COVID related content dissemination to other networks  Restrictions applin Pakistan This is especially important

focusing on the
COVID19 discourse We have aualyzed WhatsApp text
and image messages collected for more than 6 weeks from
227 public WhatsApp groups to shed light on the salient
misinformation dissemination trends and to share insights
on how Pakistani social media users are experiencing and
responding to the COVID19 paudemic Our work is unique
as this is the first work to not only study misinformation trends on WhatsApp but also find a relation between
WhatsApp and Twitter Our aualyses showed that while

the majority of shared information is not
misinformation misinformation seems to have a longer
lifespau on WhatsApp compared to other types of COVID
messages the lifetime of misinformation is roughly 4 times
that of correct
information On Twitter the inverse was
seen as COVID misinformation tended to disappear from
Twitter 3 times faster than information This can potentially
be attributed to the open nature of Twitter and how a vast
number of users can publicly negate such tweets While
observing user behavior we found 8 images that could be
attributed to organized disinformation other than that we
did not find any evidence of disinformation within imagesWhereas more work is required in detecting disinformation
via text messages We conclude by saying that our dataset
has only scratched the surface of how user interactions
happen on WhatsApp More work needs to be performed to
understand user behavior and new ways need to be proposed
to detect misinformation in such closed networks
Blackbox Adversarial Machine Learning Attack on
Network Trafc ClassicationMuhammad Usama Adnan Qayyum Junaid Qadir Ala AlFuqaha
Information Technology University Punjab PakistanHamad Bin Khalifa University Doha Qatar
Email muhammadusama adnanqayyum junaidqadirituedupk aalfuqahahbkueduqaAbstractDeep machine learning techniques have shown
promising results in network trafc classication however the
robustness of these techniques under adversarial threats is stiin question Deep machine learning models are found vulnerable
to small carefully crafted adversarial perturbations posing a
major question on the performance of deep machine learning
techniques In this paper we propose a blackbox adversariaattack on network trafc classication The proposed attack
successfully evades deep machine learningbased classiers which
highlights the potential security threat of using deep machine
learning techniques to realize autonomous networksIndex TermsAdversarial machine learning Blackbox adversarial attack Network trafc classicationI INTRODUCTION
Network trafc classication is an important task in network
engineering It provides a method for monitoring understand
ing and quantifying network trafc With the emergence of
5G Internet of Things IoT and other related technologies
network trafc volume is expected to grow up to 33 Zettabyte
ZB per year or 35 Gigabyte GB per capita per month
by 2021  With this exponential growth in network trafc
volume and inception of many datahungry communication
applications network trafc classication becomes a very
challenging problem for users and service providers Classicanetwork trafc classication techniques are based on port and
payload inspection but these schemes have their shortcomings
in terms of dealing with a large amount of data and different
types of network trafcRecent advances in machine learning ML such as deep
learning DL techniques have produced exceptional results
in many application domains including computer vision
natural language processing speech recognition and system
control DL is a branch of MLtechniques where a hierarchicastructure of neural network layers is used to autonomously
learn the features and then those learned features are used
for classication or prediction The success of MLDL in
multiple application domains has motivated the networking
community to explore the potential benets of these techniques
for building an autonomous control for improving the per
formance of networking applications such as network trafc
classication anomaly and intrusion detection In the last few
years many MLDL based networking solutions have been
proposed highlighting the applications and challenges of using
ML techniques in the networking domain    
Recently MLDL techniques were found to be vulnerable
to carefully crafted perturbations in the test examples Theseexamples are known as adversarial ML examples Adversariaexamples force the MLDL algorithm to malfunction and
produce incorrect results DL schemes especially deep neuranetworks DNN are function approximators that have an
associated generalization error which makes them vulnerable
to adversarial ML attacks Adversarial ML attacks can be
divided into two broader categories based on the adversarys
knowledge namely whitebox adversarial attacks ie per
fect knowledge and blackbox adversarial attacks ie real
world settingsIn this paper we take network trafc classication as a
functional proxy for MLDL based autonomous networking
applications and propose a blackbox adversarial ML attack on
network trafc classication Although the focus of our paper
is on network trafc classication our ndings are broadly
applicable to similar settings that involve other applications of
MLDL to realize autonomous networks The purpose of our
proposed attack is to compromise the integrity of network traf
c classication to shed light on the risks involved in utilizing
MLDL techniques in support of networking applicationsOur results indicate that the current state of the art MLDbased network trafc classication algorithms do not pro
vide substantial deterrence against adversarial ML attacksOur experiments utilize the highly cited TornonTor dataset

Mutual InformationIII METHODOLOGYIn this section we describe the approach that we followed
to design a blackbox adversarial ML attack on deep ML
based Tor trafc classication which is used as a proxy  Restrictions applyto represent other network functional areas To the best of
our knowledge no standardized deep MLbased Tor trafc
classication method has been proposed yet Although as
mentioned in Section II neural networks have outperformed
other MLDL techniques for Tor trafc classication we
utilize both DNNs and SVM for Tortrafc classication We
utilize the mutual information MI for crafting adversariaperturbations and substitute model training to perform the
blackbox adversarial attack Before discussing the design of
the deep ML classier and the adversarial attack we describe
the threat model and related assumptionsA Threat ModeIn this subsection we delineate the threat model assump
tions Table I provides a summary of the notation used in our
blackbox attack procedure1 Adversary Knowledge The proposed attack in this paper
only considers blackbox adversarial ML attack model where
the adversary has no knowledge of training data number of
layers in the model training hyperparameters type of layers
and training data The adversary can only access the output
of the deep ML model ie DNN in this case in a query
response manner The adversary can send an input to the modeand collect the label as a response These queryresponse pairs
are later used for crafting an adversarial attack We assume that
the adversary can only perform an adversarial attack during
the test time Other attacks such as poisoning attacks are not
within the scope of this study2 Adversarial Goals The goal of the adversary is to
compromise the integrity and availability of the Tor trafc
classier by minimally altering the test examples In adver
sarial attacks on computer vision and natural language pro
cessing applications the fundamental restriction on adversariaexamples is to preserve the visual representation or semantic
meaning of the image or text respectively This restriction is
replaced with a more difcult one in the context of networking
where the adversary has to ensure that the applied adversariaperturbation does not affect the functional behavior of the
network trafcB Tor Classication ModeIn this work We use DNN and SVM for Tor trafc
classication SVM is a well known ML technique used for
classication and regression Whereas DNNs are wellknown
for being capable of solving complex classication tasks by
extracting hierarchical representation from their input DNN
consists of multiple layers of neurons smallest computationaunit each layers output is the input of the next layer The
nonlinear activation function is used to ensure that each
neuron also learns nonlinear information The output layer of
the DNN uses softmax as activation function to produce the
classication probability vectorWe use the DNN and SVM classiers for binary and multi
class classication where binary classication is performed
between Tor and nonTor trafc and multiclass classication
is performed between different Tor trafc classes We used
stochastic gradient descent with a batch size of 100 for
training the classier We used a 7030 ratio of the dataFigure 1 Steps for designing a blackbox adversarial attack on network trafc
classication processes through synthetic data generation substitute modegeneration and adversarial sample craftingfor training and validation purposes We achieved 96 and
9354 accuracy for binary class classication using DNN and
SVM respectively For multiclass classication we achieved
9060 and 8060 accuracy using DNN and SVM respec
tively Classication accuracy of both models can be improved
by carefully choosing hyperparameters for DNN trainingC Blackbox Attack ProcedureIn this subsection we delineate the procedure used to per
form the blackbox adversarial ML attack on Tor trafc classi
cation models The proposed adversarial attack is performed
in two steps namely substitute model training and adversariasample crafting Figure 1 provides a detailed description of the
process used to perform a blackbox adversarial attack on Tor
trafc classication1 Substitute Model Training According to the assump
tions provided in IIIA the adversary can only query the
deployed MLDL model F with synthetic input data Q to
get a label as a response Y  These queryresponse pairs are
then used for training a substitute model architecture S The
in training S is to mimic the decision boundary of
goathe deployed classier F  This process is divided into two
components namely substitute model architecture design 
synthetic dataset collection and substitute DNN training on
synthetic datasetSubstitute model architecture design and synthetic dataset
collection are very challenging tasks Since the adversary has
no information about F s architecture and training process
selection of appropriate architecture for S and training pro
cedures are performed heuristically In our experiments we
selected DNN as our substitute architecture The adversariaattack proposed in this paper is also applicable to other MLDarchitectures with some modications to the training processThe adversary can also train multiple MLDL models to nd
the besttrained substitute model Sapprox Substitute model S is
trained using synthetic data samples Q prepared by querying
F for labels Y  We used a moderate number of queries to
develop synthetic data for training S Initially the adversary
sends queries to F from a set Q of synthetic trafc samples
obtained by using Tor and a regular browser to get labels Y  Restrictions applyEach query along with its response label is stored as a synthetic
data pair in synthetic dataset dictionary DOnce we obtain a moderate amount of synthetic datain
our case 2644 queryresponse pairsthe substitute DNN is
trained on this synthetic dataset Binary cross entropy and
categorical cross entropy loss functions are used in binary and
multiclass classication We utilized the stochastic gradient
descent algorithm for training the substitute model S The
complete training process is described in AlgorithmAlgorithm 1 Substitute DNN TrainingInput F  S and Q

return Sapprox DLD SD Adversarial Sample CraftingOnce the substitute classier S is trained it is used to
generate the adversarial attack Since the adversary knows
every detail about the trained substitute model Sapprox it is
very easy to generate an adversarial perturbation for SapproxTo perturb Sapprox an adversary needs to nd the most dis
criminant feature and to slightly perturb it Formally speaking
an adversarial perturbation for network trafc is an input that
when added to the actual input does not lose its functionabehavior but gets classied in a different class In our binary
class classication case a small perturbation in the Tor sample
will force the classier to classify Tor sample in the nonTor
categoryWe use MI mathematical notation IX Y  for most
discriminative feature detection for adversarial sample craft
ing The MI IX Y  is dened as the measure of statisticadependence between two random variables The MI between
two random variables X and Y is given as
cidpx ylogpx ypxpyIX Y  XYTo select the most discriminative feature from synthetic data
D we calculate MI between each feature and label pair The
top n n can vary between 1 to any moderate number of
features while maintaining the functional behavior features
having the highest values of MI are selected as the most
discriminant features MI value of any feature also depicts
its inuence on the classication procedure Once the most
discriminative features are selected they are perturbed sparsely
using L1 norm minimization the perturbation is always kept
less than 102 The adversarial sample crafting algorithm is
provided in AlgorithmOnce the adversarial examples crafted using the Algorithm
2 have successfully evaded Sapprox according to the adversariaML transferability property 
the adversarial examples
evading the integrity of Sapprox are highly likely to compromise
the integrity of F  In our experiments we evaluated the
adversarial examples on F and the corresponding results are
provided in Section IV where for both binary and multiclass
classication the crafted blackbox adversarial examples have
successfully evaded the deployed MLbased network Tortrafc classication systemFor an adversarial attack to be practical in cognitive net
working it is important that the original packets functionality
is preserved even though the attacker is perturbing the packet
with the intention of tricking the classier We assume that the
perturbations can be reversed through a middlebox employed
by the adversary or that the adversary uses the portions of
packets for the perturbation that are otherwise unrelated to
the packets functionality eg through extra padding or using
unused control eldsAlgorithm 2 Adversarial Sample Crafting AlgorithmInput Sapprox DQ Y

adversarial attack Through our experiments we want to afrm
the hypothesis that the blackbox adversarial example crafting
algorithm proposed in this paper allows us to successfully
fool the MLbased Tor trafc classication model In our
experiments we consider DNN and SVM based binary class
and multiclass Tor trafc classiers Drop in accuracy is
considered as a measure of success for the proposed black

perturbed using L1 norm minimization and the perturbation
was limited to being less than 10In the binary classication case Tor vs nonTor we
achieved 96 and 9354 classication accuracy on the legit
imate samples using DNN and SVM classiers respectivelyWhen the proposed blackbox adversarial attack was applied
we observed a signicant drop in classication performanceWe created 2644 adversarial samples of Tor trafc When these
adversarial samples were subjected to the binary classiers
we observed that the classication accuracy of the DNN
based classier has dropped from 96 to 77 and the
SVMbased classiers accuracy has dropped from 9354to

proposed blackbox attack to target the integrity of a single
class ie Chat For adversarial sample crafting algorithm
we have considered chat vs nonchat classication Once
the adversarial sample is crafted for chat class it is sub
jected to a DNN and SVM based multiclass classier This
process also proves the transferability of adversarial examples
in networking domain This experiment was performed to
highlight that the proposed blackbox attack can also perform
targeted attacks Legitimate Chat samples were classied
with 963 and 964 accuracy by DNN and SVM based
classiers respectively After the adversarial attack the clas
sication accuracy of the same class has suffered a signicant
drop For the DNNbased multiclass classier the accuracy
dropped from 963 to 2 which is a drop of nearly 94
in performance conrming our hypothesis that DNNbased
network trafc classiers are very vulnerable to adversariaperturbations For the SVMbased multiclass classier we
observed a performance drop from 964 to 6395 which
is nearly a 33 drop in accuracy by only perturbingtrafc features Table III provides the performance of proposed

in crosslanguage scenarios due to differences in linguistic and
cultural expression of emotions across languages Recently large
multilingual foundation models pretrained on massive corpora
have achieved performance on natural language understanding
tasks by learning crosslingual representations Their ability
to understand relationships between languages without direct
translation opens up possibilities for more applicable multilinguamodels In this paper we evaluate the capabilities of foundation
models Wav2Vec2 XLSR Whisper and MMS to bridge the
gap in crosslanguage SER Specifically we analyse their per
formance on benchmark crosslanguage SER datasets involving
four languages for emotion classification Our experiments show
that the foundation model outperforms CNNLSTM baselines
establishing their superiority in crosslingual transfer learning
for emotion recognition However selfsupervised pretraining
plays a key role and inductive biases alone are insufficient
for high crosslingual generalisability Foundation models also
demonstrate gains over baselines with limited target data and
better performance on noisy data Our findings indicate that
while foundation models hold promise pretraining remains vitafor handling linguistic variations across languages for SERIndex Termscrosslanguage speech emotion recognition
foundation models transformers multilingual data and self
supervised learningI INTRODUCTIONSpeech emotion recognition SER is a technique for un
derstanding human communication both interpersonal and
between people and machines  With the potential to be a
technology in forthcoming artificial general intelligence new
applications of SER are emerging at a pace ranging from
healthcare to transportation forensics to education entertain
ment to social media SER classifies emotional categories by
analysing audio signals such as pitch intensity and spectro
grams  However dealing with crosslingual inputs makes
the job difficult since slight cultural and linguistic variances
cast suspicion on the performance of the SER systems Though emotional expressions are universal across languagesthe peculiarities of each language present an impediment to
emotional interpretation Therefore advancing the capabilities
of SER necessitates an understanding of the interactions be
tween language culture and affective expression  Machine
learning MLenabled SER systems have outperformed legacy
emotion recognition systems and are now gaining traction in
industry and academia  As SER systems are now capable
of solving the riddle of understanding and modelling human
emotion with the aid of various context variables such as
gender age dialect and culture
is now imperative to
incorporate foundation modellike abilities into SER systems
   It would allow SER systems to understand cross
lingual emotion and act as a bridge towards the revolution in
humanmachine interaction HCI by enabling effective service
delivery in a wider range of realworld applicationsitThe performance of MLbased SER in crosslanguage sce
narios faces limitations due to several factors A key factor is
the language and cultural barrier  while human emotions
are universal their expression differs based on ones language
speech patterns and culture As a result the same emotion
manifests with diverse cues and syntax across languages
posing a challenge   Another complication arises from
culturalspecific linguistic nuances affecting emotional cuesDatasets used to train MLbased SER capture the nuances of a
single languageculture While performance may be adequate
in that language understanding other speech patterns faces
issues  Additionally overlapping phonemes can cause
misclassification exacerbated by phonetic relatedness between
languages SER requires extensive annotated data to learn
emotion patterns but datasets are limited for many languagesWithout sufficient data classification accuracy is restricted
 Current SER is also influenced by a single languageAddressing biases through multilanguage training with fair
ness could help However variability in emotion expression
and data scarcity present hurdles   Restrictions applyRecently large foundation models pretrained on massive
corpora using selfsupervised techniques have achieved re
sults across natural language understanding tasks by learning
robust crosslingual representations   Their ability
to understand relationships between languages without direct
translation opens up possibilities for more universally appli
cable multilingual models  Their scale of training allows
them to discover deeper mappings between languages than was
previously possible Where traditional models focus narrowly
on attributes of a single language foundation models can learn
shared semantic structures underlying emotional expressions
across diverse cultures and tongues  This expanded scope
of understanding makes them suited to bridge gaps faced
by traditional crosslanguage SER systems By leveraging
relationships between languages at both semantic and phonetic
levels foundation models hold the promise of speech emotion
classifiers that generalise more effectively across linguistic
barriers  Foundation models enabling cheaper annotation
may help generate annotated datasets to tackle the lack of data
and aid effective crosslanguage SER design In this paper we evaluate multiple multilingual foundation
models  Wav2Vec2  XLSR  Whisper  and
MMS The major contributions of this work include We experimentally investigated the possibility of using
foundation models Wav2Vec2  XLSR  Whisper
 and MMS  to bridge the gap in crosslanguage

emotion detection and evaluated the performance of pre
trained foundation models Here we also note that the
proposed method is scalable to many languages We also provided the generalisation and robustness per

   A key challenge is the limited availability of

datasets used for finetuning We have selected various foun
dation models for comparison to gauge their performance
against the baseline CNNLSTM model Below we provide
an overview of these models and datasetsA Baseline ModeOur baseline model incorporates a convolutional encoder
structure coupled with a Bidirectional LSTM BLSTM for
classification tasks The convolutional layers within the en
coder are designed to capture highlevel emotional features In
line with past research  we use a larger kernel size
for the initial convolutional layer and subsequently a smaller
kernel for the subsequent layers The encoders features are
then passed to the BLSTM layer housing 128 LSTM units
to capture emotional contexts These outputs from BLSTM
are fed into a dense layer consisting of 128 units generat
ing discriminative features for the subsequent softmax layerOverall the model is trained using the crossentropy loss for
categorical SERB Pretrained foundation modelsWe employ a simple head architecture and build it on top of

SER tasks as illustrated in TableB Fewshots AdaptationIn this experiment we delve into the impact of fewshot
adaptation for crosslanguage settings Essentially we combine
a subset of samples from a target language with our main
training data to observe the outcomes The IEMOCAP dataset
serves as our primary training resource in this experiment and
we use other datasets as test data We finetuned foundation
models and the results of our findings are illustrated in Figure
2 To cover a wide spectrum we alter the sample size
beginning with zero and ramping up to 200 We initiate our
tests with 50 samples for each individual emotion From there
we methodically increase the sample count examining results
at 100 150 and 200 sample thresholds As depicted in Figure
2 a clear pattern emerges employing fewshot adaptation
while finetuning the pretrained foundation model notably
boosts crosslanguage SER surpassing the conventional mod
els like the CNNLSTM model Importantly this experiment
also highlights the elevated efficiency of foundation models
pretrained on datasets comprising multiple language data
such as XLSR Whiper and MMS These models outperform
Wav2Vec2 which is only trained on English language dataThis result highlights how using varied language data for
training can make a difference especially in recognising emo
tions across languages Incorporating a few samples from the
target data into the training set can notably boost performance
paving the way for realworld applications of SERC Robustness of Pretrained ModelsIn this experiment we delve into the robustness of various
architectures especially contrasting traditional models like
CNNLSTM with transformerbased models pretrained on
vast and diverse datasets The test conditions involve the intro
duction of ambient noisespecifically kitchen park station
traffic and cafeteria sounds from the DEMAND dataset This noise is interspersed randomly within the test datasetPerformance assessments are then made on the data with a
signaltonoise SNR ratio of 10 dB against clean speech
and the findings are captured in Figure 3 Several observations
emerge from this analysis Pretrained foundation model given
their extensive training on a large corpus of data seemingly
display an innate ability to handle noisy disruptions betterIt is plausible that their expansive training data encompassed
various noisy environments furnishing them with the capabil
ity to better adapt to and process distorted auditory signalsTheir SER performance in the context of noise tolerance
distinctively eclipses that of the conventional CNNLSTM
modeFurthermoreit becomes evidentthat sheer volume and
diversity in training data play pivotal roles in noise resilienceModels like XLSR Whiper and MMS pretrained on sub
stantial multilingual datasets illustrate superior performancemetrics compared to the Wav2Vec2 base This differential is
not just attributable to the advanced transformer architecture
but also the breadth of their training data Specifically the
Wav2Vec2 base model constrained by its training solely on
English data struggles to match the versatility and adaptability
of its more extensively trained counterparts This reaffirms the
notion that diversity in trainingboth in terms of language
and acoustic conditionsequips models with a more holistic
noiseresistant capabilityV CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOKIn this paper we evaluated the performance of different
foundation models for crosslanguage speech emotion recog
nition Based on our experiments and analysis we conclude
the following Foundation models like XLSR Whisper and MMS sig
nificantly outperform traditional CNNLSTM approaches
for crosslanguage SER achieving higher UAR scores
across different language pairs This establishes the su
periority of foundation models in handling crosslingualearning for emotion recognition As found previously  Wav2Vec2 when initialised
randomly showed performance comparable to CNN
LSTM However models like XLSR Whisper and MMS
which are pretrained on massive multilanguage datasets
demonstrate improved performance in crosslanguage
SER compared to Wav2Vec2 trained on singlelanguage
data The distinct advantage underscores the significance
of diverse pretraining datasets in elevating the capabili
ties of speech models for finetuning tasks Adapting the foundation models with a few target lan
guage samples resulted in substantial gains over the base
line demonstrating their ability to effectively leverage
limited target data The foundation models also exhibited better robustness
over CNNLSTM when evaluated on noisy target data
maintaining higher UAR scoresIn conclusion while foundation models hold promise for
crosslanguage tasks selfsupervised pretraining currently
plays a vital complementary role in equipping them with the
necessary skills for handling linguistic and cultural variations
across languages Further research can explore inductive bi
ases that facilitate improved crosslingual transfer ability of
foundation models

Over the last decades widespread adoption of digitaapplications  has  moved  all  aspects  of  human  livesinto  the  digital  sphere  The  commoditization  of  thedata  collection  process  due  to  increased  digitizationhas resulted in a data deluge that continues to inten

cussed nextBig Data is Reductionist
Big Data provides a granular view of extremely complexand  historically  unprecedented  problems  by  using  par
ticular  vantage  points  from  the  available  data  It  onlyfocuses on specific types of questions and seeks theiranswers  in  a  reductionist  way  by  seemingly  ignoringconcrete contextual realities about human societies andplaces It is also crude and reductionist in its techniquesand  algorithms  by  sacrificing  complexity  specificityand deep contextual knowledge  In this way analy
ses are reduced to simple outputs that critically ignorethe  underlying  complexity  of  the  actual  processes  andentities being modeled Big Data is not Neutral nor is it Objective
One of the compelling aspects of Big Data is the assump
tion  that  it  is  eliminating  human  subjectivity  and  biasAlthough the idea of baggagefree learning is seductivedata alone is not enough since there is no learning with
out knowledge as a practical consequence of the no freelunch  theorem  Big  Data  analytics  is  what  mathemati
cians  call  an  illposed  problem  thus  no  unique  modeexists1 the only way to resolve some illposed problemsis  to  make  additional  assumptions  These  assumptionsare subjective and can be thought of as being opinionsembedded  in  Math    Therefore  while  data  is  oftenconsidered neutral data collection techniques and analy
sis  methods  are  designed  by  humans  based  on  theirknowledge experience and beliefsAn uncritical acceptance andcareless application of Big Datamethods can adversely affect humanwelfare and developmentThe German philosopher Heidegger wroteEverywhere  we  remain  unfree  and  chained  totechnology whether we passionately affirm or denyit But we are delivered over to it in the worst possi
ble way when we regard it as something neutralBig  Data  scientists  make  computations  using  dataand  present  results  about  people  in  terms  of  numbersor  mathematical  relations  based  on  layers  upon  layersof assumptions Data scientists use this data and try toorganize  it  into  objects  relations  and  events  and  indoing  so  invariably  analyze  the  data  within  the  back
drop  of  their  subjectivity  and  partiality  Moreover  it  ischallenging to ensure fairness in ML algorithms due tosignificant  statistical  limitations  and  it  is  possible  thatenforcing fairness can harm the very groups that thesealgorithms were supposed to protect Opaque BlackBox Models
Many of the modern mathematical models used for BigData  analysis  are  opaque    and  unregulated  These  models  are  often  used  inappropriately  and  canscale  up  biases  thereby  producing  misleading  results1A famous statistical quote by George Box is All models are wrong someare usefulSuch models have even been referred to as weapons ofmaths destruction WMD due to their inscrutable blackbox  nature  These  WMDs  can  cause  havocharm  andtend to punish the poor due to vicious feedback loops The reliance on opaque algorithmic black boxes fordecision  making  is  even  more  problematic  when  weconsider  how  easy  it  is  for  adversaries  to  attack  Mmodels  New  research  attacks  have  emerged  in  whichadversaries  can  trick  ML  models  to  make  decisions  asthey  desire    something  that  has  huge  consequencesfor  a  society  in  which  human  decisions  are  automatedand made by machinesBig Datas Big Bias Problem
Most  Big  Data  datasets  contain  hidden  biases  both  incollection and analysis stage These biases in data cancreate  an  illusion  of  reality  These  biases  are  hard  toundo  and  their  elimination  have  unintended  conse
quences  on  the  results  Four  major  biases  of  Big  Dataare described as followsSampling Bias When the samples are partial selec
tive  and  not  random  the  patterns  of  omitted  informa
tion  may  influence  the  structures  discovered  in  thedata Such samples will be unable to accurately predictthe outcomes and will have reduced validity  Suchbias is often found when we focus on sentiment analysison  social  media  safety  monitoring  using  social  mediaor use population statistics and tourism statisticsActivity  Bias  This  is  another  bias  that  is  usuallyencountered in web data  This arises from the time
based correlation of users activities across diverse web
sites  because  most  of  the  users  visit  a  website  for  awhile and never return during the measurement periodThis can be explained using the example of the modeof Ginsberg et al Information  Bias  This  refers  to  the  delusion  thatmore  information  always  results  in  better  decisionsData  scientists  give  too  much  significance  on  the  vol
ume  of  data  and  ignore  other  alternative  opinions  andsolutions The irony of this belief is that fewer data cangive  better  decisions  in  some  situations  In  variouscases  a  simple  rule  of  thumb  can  work  better  thancomplex analysis There are situations where ignorancefrom  very  large  data  and  required  calculation  can  pro
vide  more  accurate  and  faster  results  because  largebiased data just magnify the errors Having more infor
mation is not always more desirableInductive Bias Assuming the Future Will be Like thePast In Big Data analysis there is an implicit belief thatthe future can always be extrapolated based on histori
cal data Apart from this approach being philosophically  Restrictions apply debatable  cf  the  Problem  of  Induction  such  anapproach  can  empirically  backfire  in  many  cases  andresult in invalid misleading or unhelpful analysesFooled by the Big Noise
In  the author Nate Silver notes that even thoughdata  is  increasing  globally  by  25  quintillion  byteseach day useful information is of course not increas
ing  commensurately  This  means  that  most  of  thedata  is  just  noise  and  that  noise  is  increasing  fasterthan useful information A related problem is that ofthe  curse  of  dimensionality  where  the  more  dimen
sions  one  works  with  the  less  effective  standardcomputational  and  statistical  techniques  becomewhich has serious repercussions when we are dealingwith Big Data As more data is generated and collect
ed  the  complexity  deviations  variance  or  noiseand the number of potential false findings grow expo
nentially  compared  to  the  information  or  signaThis spurious rise in data can mislead us to fake sta
tistical relationshipsAnother point of concern is that a plethora of hypoth
eses are tested using a single data in Big Data analyticswhich opens the door for spurious correlations Whena  large  number  of  hypotheses  are  tested  it  becomeshighly likely that some false results will become statisti
cally  significant  which  can  mislead  Big  Data  practitio
ners if they are not careful The proper way to formulatea  hypothesis  is  before  the  experiment  not  after  itIt is necessary to understand that the statistical signifi
cance under an inaccurate method is totally specious ie  significance  tests  do  not  protect  against  datadredging Apart from the problem of spurious correlations BigData analysts can also become guilty of cherry pickingIn this phenomenon scientists tend to focus on findingsupport for their hypotheses and beliefs while overlook
ing  other  evidence  As  a  result  they  only  present  posi
tive  results  of  their  experiments  that  endorse  theirhypothesis  or  argument  instead  of  reporting  all  of  thefindings    In  this  way  Big  Data  provide  a  relativelysmall  advantage  to  improve  public  strategies  policiesand operations with minimum public benefit Are Big Data Predictions Generalizable
In  Big  Data  analytics  datasets  are  mostly  gatheredfrom observational sources instead of a strict statisti
cal experiment This poses the question of the gener
alizability  of  the  insights  learned  from  this  datanotwithstanding  the  large  size  of  the  dataset  Eventhough  we  know  that  statistically  speaking  the  dis
crepancy  in  an  estimate  decreases  with  an  increasein the sample size as Bernoulli proved but the messi
ness  of  realworld  data  in  terms  of  incompletenessimbalance  hidden  bias  rareness  large  variancesoutliers  and  nonindependent  identically  distributedIID  nature  means  that  simply  getting  more  data  isnot sufficient Disregard for the messiness of the real
world data can mislead us into problems such as mul

Big Data opens frightening opportunities for unscrupu

es as various facets of human lives are being digitized Privacy depends on the nature and characteristicsof  data  the  context  in  which  it  was  created  and  thenorms and expectations of people  Therefore it isnecessary to situate and contextualize data in such away that minimizes privacy breaches without affectingits usefulnessBig Data can bring more transparency both for indi
viduals and organizations by introducing user anony
mization but there are numerous examples when data isthought  to  be  anonymous  but  its  combination  withother  variables  resulted  in  unexpected  reidentification   For example it has been proved that fourspatiotemporal points are sufficient to uniquely identify95 of the individuals in a dataset where the location ofan individual is specified hourly with a spatial resolutiongiven  by  the  carriers  antennas    In  another  similarstudy  Latanya  Sweeney    Americans  could  be  uniquely  recognized  using  onlythree bits of information zip code birth date and sexThe  datasets  being  released  today  are  anonymized  byapplying  ad  hoc  deidentification  methods  Thereforethe  possibility  of  reidentification  depends  heavily  onthe advancement of reidentification methods and avail

cious use of data potentially by unauthorized agentsQuality Of Statistics  Numbers are Softand Incentives Matter
Data is not simply information that is harvested from anobjective context It should be an institutionally cultur
ally and socially shaped product Collecting good quali
ty data for development is in practice very costly as weneed  resources  and  manpower  for  data  collectionmaintenance  and  monitoring    For  instance  theaggregate statistic for Gross Domestic Product GDP inmany subSaharan African countries is often measuredapproximately  since  most  African  countries  are  simplyunable to collect all the information needed to calculateGDP accurately and changes are approximately inferredfrom rainfall figures or population growth  The useof  this  data  can  lead  to  distorted  or  misleading  policydecisions  by  development  agencies  and  governmentsand can contribute to the underestimation of GDP andbewildering fallouts such as the following1  In November 2010 Ghanas Statistics Service anno
unced  an  estimated  GDP  that  was  off  from  its  truevalue resulting in an upward adjustment of a whop
ping  60  which  was  enough  to  change  Ghanasstatus from a lowincome country to a lower middle
income country 2  Similar adjustments were made in Nigeria in Apriwhere the rise was almost 90 which caused thetotal GDP of subSaharan Africa to rise by 20 But  where  did  these  overnight  growth  spurts  comefrom And what to say about the fate of the analysis andpolicies  of  the  various  policymakers  and  developmentprofessionals that were based on the previous miscalcu
lated  data    and  the  cost  of  this  misplaced  analysisThe  official  statistics  are  often  missing  incompletedated  or  unreliable  Given  such  concerns  researchershave argued that the numbers cannot be taken at facevalue  for  development  data  from  a  place  like  Africaresulting  in  what  has  been  called  Africas  statisticatragedy Pitfalls of SelfMonitoring of States
In  the  modern  world  almost  every  government  tightlycontrols  what  kind  of  information  is  disseminatedabout  the  state  An  important  aspect  of  the  selfmoni
toring of states is that it often becomes a farce becausepeople cannot keep their own score The official statis
tics  measured  by  the  government  must  be  acceptedwith  a  pinch  of  salt  since  governments  are  spinningthese numbers in ways that project the countrys prog

Human social systems are complex adaptive systemswith multiloop nonlinear feedback in which actions per
formed  for  some  purpose  can  lead  to  quite  differentunexpected and unintended consequences We wiuse two examples to illustrate the 1 unintendedconsequences  and  2  selffulfilling  nature  of  interven
tions in complex social systemsFor our first example consider the Cobra effect as anexample of an incident in which an intervention craftedto  ameliorate  a  problem  actually  aggravated  it  by  pro
ducing some unintended consequences During the Brit
ish  colonial  rule  of  India  the  government  devised  abounty  system  for  combating  the  rise  of  venomouscobras The system worked successfully initially and lotsof  snakes  were  killed  for  the  reward  but  entrepreneurs  soon figured out that they could make money by farm
ing  cobras  and  killing  more  of  them  The  governmenton learning about this scrapped the system but endedup  with  a  situation  in  which  there  were  more  cobrasafter the intervention than beforeFor  our  second  example  consider  the  Paper  Towneffect In the 20th century a famous map of New Yorkwas created by cartographers Lindberg and Alpers whocleverly  embedded  a  fake  city  Agloe  into  their  mapAgloe NY was not a real town It was a paper town  abooby trap to catch plagiarizers A few years after Lind

In  Big  Data  research  researchers  make  inferences  bytraining models on a larger subset of data with the goa  to fit the learned hypothesis on unseen data In Big Dataresearch  generalization  is  the  procedure  of  spanningthe  characteristics  of  a  group  or  class  to  the  entiregroup or population This enables the inference of attri
butes  of  an  entire  population  without  getting  to  knowevery single element in that population individually Theproblem  comes  along  when  we  wrongly  generalize  ormore  precisely  when  we  overdo  it  The  generalizationfallacy occurs when statistical inferences about a partic
ular  population  are  asserted  to  a  group  of  people  forwhich  the  original  population  is  not  a  representativesample In other words models overfit when they learnnot  only  the  signal  from  the  training  data  but  also  thenoise that impedes the models capability to predict onunseen data In order to avoid excessive generalizationerror  researchers  should  also  check  the  scope  of  theresults  instead  of  extending  scientific  findings  to  theI understand that my work mayhaenormous effects on society andthe economy many of them beyondmy comprehensionwhole  population  Regularization  is  helpful  to  avoidoverfitting by reducing the number of parameters to fitmodel  in  highdimensional  data    It  also  preventsmodel  parameters  to  change  easily  which  helps  inkeeping the focus of the model on the persistent struc
ture  Apart  from  regularization  other  techniques  suchas  crossvalidation  early  stopping  weight  sharingweight restriction sparsity constraints etc can also beused for reducing the generalization error based on thealgorithm being usedAvoiding Bias
Big Data tends to have high dimensionality and may beconflicting  subjective  redundant  and  biased  Theawareness  of  potential  biases  can  improve  the  qualityof  decisions  at  the  level  of  individuals  organizationsand  communities    In  a  study  of  1000  major  busi
ness investments conducted by McKinsey it was foundthat when organizations worked to minimize the biasesin their decisionmaking they achieved up to 7 higherreturns    The  biases  associated  with  multiple  com
parisons  can  be  deliberately  avoided  using  techniquessuch as the Bonferroni correction  the Sidak correc

domized  outofsample  experiments  during  hypothesesbuilding For example an analyst gathers a dataset andarbitrarily segments it into two subsets A and B Initial
ly  only  one  subset    say  subset  A    is  analyzed  forconstructing hypotheses Once a hypothesis is formulat

In most data analysis performed in the Big Data era thefocus  is  on  determining  correlations  rather  than  onunderstanding causality  For BD4D problems weremore interested in determvining causes rather than cor

al  relations  is  difficult  and  involves  substantial  effortand  requires  going  beyond  mere  statistical  analysis  aspointed out by Freedman Stress HighQuality Data Analytics RatherThan Big Data Analytics
A better and thoughtful understanding of risks or pitfallsof Big Data is crucial to decrease its associated poten
tial harms to individuals and society There needs to bea  stress  on  utilizing  Big  Data  along  with  data  collectedthrough traditional sources to provide a deeper clearerunderstanding of problems instead of being fixated ononly  generating  and  analyzing  large  volumes  of  dataAlthough it is generally preferred to have more data it isnot always desirable especially in the cases where datais biased Another disadvantage of large datasets is costin terms of processing storage and maintenance How
ever some simple methods like sampling andor resam
pling enable us to extract the most relevant data from alarger  chunk  of  data  Another  very  important  aspect  is to collect the desired data to properly design an experi

similar activities as humans in a more efcient manner This
longstanding challenge for developing such agents is no longer
a pipe dream thanks to rapid growth in computational AI and
ML technologies In the last decade ML and especially Dhave revolutionized elds such as computer vision language
processing etc ML is divided into three categories  namely
supervised unsupervised and reinforcement learning RL In
supervised learning training data along with the corresponding
labels are available for decision making Supervised learning is
by far the most wellstudied branch of ML for problems with
labeled data which has a lot of applications in practice such as
object recognition speech recognition spam detection pattern
recognition and many more In unsupervised learning the target
is to infer the underlying patterns and structures from unlabeled
data RL is dened as a learning process that focuses on nding
the best strategies for agents based on the interactions with the
surrounding environment Unlike supervised and unsupervised
learning processes which need training data to learn RL agents
can learn in an online manner based on observations obtained
through realtime interactions with the environmentRL utilizes a trialanderror process to solve sequentiadecisionmaking problems in robotics control and many other
realworld problems RL algorithms also have some limitations
to be utilized in practice mainly due to their slow learning process
and inability to learn in complex environments Recently a new
technique combining the advancement of DL called DRL has
been introduced  DRL has shown great results in many
complex decisionmaking processes such as designated task
completion in robotics  navigating driverless autonomous
vehicles   healthcare  nancial trading  smart grid
management  automated transportation management 
wireless and data network management  and for playing
games such as Pong  Go  etc In 2017 DRL beat the
human champions in the game of Go  and most recently
a team of ve DRL agents has beaten the world champion
human team in Dota2 matches  This shows that DRL ispromising and can address highly complex and timesensitive
decisionmaking problems in real timeWith the rapid adoption of DRL in critical realworld
applications the security of DRL has become a very important
area of research   Recently DRL has been vulnerable
to adversarial attacks where an imperceptible perturbation
is added to the input to the DRL schemes with a predened
goal of causing a malfunction in the working of DRL Thus it is crucial to understand the types and nature of these
vulnerabilities and their potential mitigation procedures before
deploying DRLbased reallife critical systems eg smart
grids and autonomous vehicles Here we want to note that the
security of supervised and unsupervised ML is well studied in the
literature  but the security of DRL has not yet received sim
ilar attention In 2018 Behzadan and Munir Contributions of This article In this article we build upon the
existing literature available on security vulnerabilities of DRand their countermeasures and provide a comprehensive and
extensive review of the related work The major contributions
of this article are as follows1 We provide the DRL fundamentals along with a nonexhaustive taxonomy of advanced DRL algorithms2 We present a comprehensive survey of adversarial attackson DRL and their potential countermeasures3 We discuss the available benchmarks and metrics for therobustness of DR4 Finally we highlight the open issues and research chal
lenges in the robustness of DRL and introduce some
potential research directionsOrganization of This article The organization of this article
is depicted in Fig 1 An overview of the challenges faced by Mand DRL schemes has been provided in Section II Sectionpresents a comprehensive review of adversarial ML attacks

proposed in the literature to ensure robustness against adver
sarial attacks is presented in Section IV Section V presents
the available benchmarking tools and metrics along with open
research problems in DRL Section VI describes the open issues
and research challenges in designing adversarial attacks and ro
bustness mechanisms for DRL Finally we conclude this article
in Section VII For the convenience of the reader a summary
of the salient acronyms used in this article is presented in the
NomenclatureII BACKGROUNDIn this section we discuss the fundamentals of the DRprocess Then we provide a summary of the shortcomings of
the ML and DRL techniques  Restrictions applyIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE VOL 3 NO 2 APRFig 1 Organization of this articleFig 2 Basic process of the MDP in RA Fundamentals of DRThe important concepts used in DRL are described as follows1 Markov decision process A generic RL problem is
described as an MDP in terms of the state action reward
and dynamics of the system In an MDP at each time step
the agent observes the current state st and performs an
action at based on its current policy  After the action is
executed the agent observes its reward rt and next state
st1 The objective of an MDP is to nd the best actions
which maximize its longterm expected reward Figillustrates a typical MDP setup with an agent interacting
with its surrounding environment2 Environment is a simulator or a realworld scenario in
which the agent interacts and learns At each time step
the agent governed by the policy interacts with the
environment and in return receives a reward Environ
ment is divided into two categories namely partially
observable and fully observable In the case of a partially
observable environment the agent is only able to partiallyobserve the environment For these partially observable
environments POMDPs are used In a fully observable
environment the agent can observe all the states and we
use MDPs for this MDPs are a special case of POMDPs
where the observation function is identity3 Action is a stimulus used by the agent for interactions
with the environment The actions can be discrete or
continuous based on the environment and DRL problem
formulation4 Reward is an incentive expressed by a numerical value
that the agent receives after making an action The goaof an agent is to maximize the accumulated reward To
reduce the impact of the reward r which the agent might
get in a later state due to taking a specic action a in the
current state st the notion of discounted rewards was
introduced It is usually denoted by  and can take any
value ranging from 0 to 1 Mathematically the discounted
reward Rt given asRt Tcidtcid3ttcid3trstcidwhere t denotes the time step T is the nal time step r
denotes the reward for the time step and st denotes the
current state5 Value function species the value of a state Value is
dened as the maximum expected discounted reward of
a certain state Mathematically it is determined asVs  ERts  stwhere  is the policy Rt is the discounted reward and
st is the current state6 Qfunction species the Qvalue of a state Qvalue is
dened as the maximum expected discounted reward an Fig 3 Nonexhaustive taxonomy of major DRL schemes as proposed in agent may get by taking a specic action at a specic
state Mathematically it can be calculated as followsQs  ERts  st a  atwhere  is the policy Rt is the discounted reward st is
the current state and at is the current action7 Advantage function is the difference of the Qvalue of a
specic action at a state Qs a from the value of that
state V s ie As a  Qs a  V s8 Policy denes how the agent will behave in the envi
ronment at a particular time In other words it is a
mapping from the perceived states of the environment
to the actions taken in those conditions A policy is said
to be optimal if it achieves the maximum possible reward
at each state Policies are further divided into two typesdeterministic policy and stochastic policy When actions
taken by the agent are deterministic the policy is termed
as deterministic On the other hand when the actions
are sampled from the conditional probability distribution
of actions given the states the policy is called to be
stochastic9 Onpolicy algorithms enable an agent to learn and update
its policy in an online manner through realtime interac
tion with the environment Samples generated from the
current policy are used to train the algorithm to estimate
the policy in advance10 Offpolicy algorithms use an online policy and a target
policy The target policy is used to estimate the action val
ues while the online policy is being learned Hence the
agent can estimate the target policy without its complete
knowledge11 Model mimics the behavior of the environment hence
allowing inferences to be made about the behavior of
the environment Based on the availability of the system
models the DRL schemes are divided into further two
categories namely modelbased and modelfree R12 Exploration and exploitation Exploration is the process
when the agent tries to explore the surrounding environ
ment by taking different actions available at a given stateExploitation occurs after exploration The agent exploitsthe optimal actions to achieve the maximum cumulative
reward An cid4greedy policy is used to balance exploration
and exploitation The agent chooses a random action
with a certain probability otherwise it takes the action
followed by the policy The probability of the random
action being taken keeps decreasing with each time stepThis change factor is usually denoted by A taxonomy of major DRL algorithms as proposed in B Security of MAlthough the utilization of ML techniques has revolutionized
many areas including vision language speech and control
it has also introduced new security challenges that are very
threatening in designing and developing new dynamic intelli
gent systems Security attacks in ML can be divided into two
categories training phase attacks and inference phase attacksFor the training phase attacks the adversary tries to force the
learning process to learn faulty modelpolicy by introducing
small imperceptible perturbations to the input data Inference
phase attacks are performed by the adversary at the inferencetest
time of the ML pipeline to fool the modelpolicy in providing
malfunctioned resultsactionsThe malicious input generated by adding adversarial perturba
tions into the original input is known as an adversarial exampleAdversarial examples are classied into four major categories
based on the objective knowledge frequency and specicityFormally an adversarial example x is created by adding a
small imperceptible carefully crafted perturbation  to the cor
rectly classied example x The perturbation  is calculated
by approximating the optimization problem iteratively until the
crafted adversarial example gets classied by ML classier fin targeted class t as followsx  x  arg min
xcid4cid4  f x    twhere t is the targeted class Fig 4 shows a basic taxonomy of
attacks on M  Restrictions applyIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE VOL 3 NO 2 APRFig 4 Taxonomy of adversarial ML attacks classied according to the adversarys objective knowledge specicity and attack frequency1 Attacks Based on Adversarys Knowledge Depending on
the adversarys knowledge about the targeted ML model adver
sarial attacks are divided into further three categories whitebox
attacks graybox attacks and blackbox attacks In the case of
whitebox attacks the adversary has perfect knowledge of the
target MLDL algorithm ie the adversary knows the training
and testing data parameters of the model etc These attacks
are used for the worstcase security malfunction analysis of an
MLDL system In the case of graybox attacks the adversary is
supposed to have limited knowledge knowledge about feature
representation and optimization algorithms only about the tar
geted MLDL model The adversary designs a surrogate modeon the limited knowledge available and uses transferability
property 2 Attacks Based on Adversarys Goals Based on the adver
sarys objective adversarial attacks are divided into four types1 condence reduction attacks in which adversarial attacks
are launched to compromise the condence levels of the
predictions of the deployed MLDLbased system2 misclassication attacks in which adversarial attacks are
launched for disturbing the classication boundary of any
class to cause misclassication3 targeted misclassication attacks in which adversariaattacks are launched to misclassify only a targeted class
and4 sourcetarget misclassication attacks in which adversar
ial attacks are launched to force misclassication of a
specic source class into a specically targeted class3 Attacks Based on Adversarys Specicity Based on speci
city adversarial examples can be classied into two types ie
targeted and nontargeted These concepts are similar to the ones
as in the case of the adversarys objective In the case of targeted
attacks the attackers target specic classes in the output while
in the case of nontargeted attacks the goal is to misclassify the
maximum number of samplesAlthough adversarial examples are transferable from one
ML model to another in many cases the performance of the
transferred examples is not enough To further improve the
performance of blackbox attacks while reducing the number
of queries needed for the attack queryefcient blackbox at
tacks are required Different queryefcient blackbox attack
methods are available in the literature Cheng et al C Security of DRThe increasing use of DRL in practical applications has led
to an investigation of the security risks it faces However the
security challenges faced by DRL are different from those ex
perienced by other ML algorithms The major difference is that
a DRL process is trained to solve sequential decisionmaking 5 Taxonomy of adversarial attacks on DRL classied according to the major parts of DRproblems in contrast to most other ML schemes that are trained
to solve singlestep prediction problems The independence of
the current actions from the previous ones increases the degrees
of freedom of adversarial attacks raising new challenges that
must be addressed This makes the adversarial attacks more
challenging to be recognized as we cannot discriminate between
the action intentionally taken by the agent and the action the
adversary forceslures the agent to take Also the training is
done on a dataset from a xed distribution in the case of
ML in contrast to the DRL where the agent begins with a
deterministic or stochastic policy and starts exploring for best
actionsUsually RL problems are formulated as an MDP consisting
of four parts S A R P  where S is the state space A is the
action space R is the reward function and P is the transition
matrix between states Hence an adversary has more choices
to attack If the adversary targets the state space impercepti
ble perturbations can be added to the environment directly by
perturbing the sensors  Similarly an adversary can target
any of the four major components of the MDP Adversariaattacks on DRL are classied into inferencetime and training
time attacks  An adversary may compromise one or more
than one dimension of condentiality integrity and availability
Based on the goal of the adversary the adversarial attacks
on DRL can be classied into active or passive  For active
attacks the adversary desires to change the behavior of the agent
while for passive attacks the adversary desires to infer details
about the model reward function or other parts of DRL An
adversary can use these details to either create a copy of the
model or use them to perform an attack on the model The
adversary may be limited by the part of the environment where
an adversary is only capable of making changes to a certain area
of the environment Adding a lot of perturbation in a single time
instance may make the attack perceptible which is not preferred
by the adversary Distinguishing the adversarial samples and
behavior from the normal ones in the case of DRL is not as
easy as in supervised learning because of the increased possible
attack dimensionsIII ADVERSARIAL ATTACKS ON DRIn this section we discuss the adversarial attacks on DRWe divide the attacks on DRL into four categories based on the
functional components of the DRL process A major portion
of the attacks involve the addition of adversarial perturbations
to the state space and a small portion of the proposed attacks
involve perturbing the reward and action space Fig 5 shows a
basic taxonomy of the adversarial attacks on DRL algorithmsA Attacks Perturbing the State SpaceWe divide this subsection based on the access of the adversary1 Manipulating the Observations Since DNNs are vulner
able to adversarial attacks in supervised learning we would
expect DNNs trained via DRL to also be vulnerable Indeed
Behzadan and Munir   Restrictions applyIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE VOL 3 NO 2 APRperturbations to the observations The rst attack is based on
a naive approach of adding random noise to the DRL states
to mislead the DRL agent in selecting a suboptimal action
that decays the performance of the DRL scheme The second
attack is a GB attack where a new cost function is introduced
for creating adversarial actions that outperforms the FGSM
in determining the worst possible discrete action to limit the
performance of DRL schemes The third attack is an improved
version of the second attack Instead of using a simple GB
approach for generating adversarial perturbation the authors
use SGD for adversarial action generation which ultimately
misleads the DRL agent to end up in a predened adversariastateKos and Song A similar issue has been raised by Sun et al  Further
more they discuss that the previously proposed attacks are
not generalpurpose and have limitations eg Hussenot et al FigProcess of policy induction attack both white and blackbox settings They show the DQN to be
more susceptible to adversarial attacks than the TRPO and A3CLin et al Tretschk et al Pattanaik et al  example with a target action 3 the agent takes an action and 4 environment generates the next state stIllustration of enchanting attack on Pacman is depicted which is highlighting all four components 1 action sequence planning 2 crafting an adversariaattack situations whereas in the case of targeted attacks the
FGSM is not able to generate imperceptible adversarial samplesChan et al cMARL algorithms are gaining attention in a wide range of
applications such as cellular base station control  trafc
light control  and autonomous driving  The target of
the agent in cMARL is to learn to take action cooperatively
as a team to maximize a total team reward Lin et al Despite the success of DRL there is little research that
studies the impact of adversarial attacks in DRL algorithmsthat do not use images as inputs Wang et al 2 Manipulating the Environment Adversarial attacks on
the state space can also be carried out by adding perturbations
in the environment of the agent In turn this causes the agent
to consider the environment as the adversary desires Chen et
al Bai et al Xiao et al   Restrictions applyIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE VOL 3 NO 2 APRGleave et al Although the DRL techniques work better in navigation tasks
they are more vulnerable to adversarial attacks than the classic
methods Yang et al 3 Manipulating the Training Data The adversary can also
choose to perturb the training data to indirectly having the agent
follow a targeted policy An adversary may create and hide some
deciencies in the policy to use them later for his benet Kiourti
et al A similar approach has been proposed by Behzadan and
Hsu A similar observation has been shown by Usama et al They argue that a lot of research is being done for creating AIMsolutions to problems in future networks such as Internet of
Things and 6G They show these ML systems to be vulnerable
by highlighting the adversarial dimension of these systems They
prove their point by attacking a DRLbased channel autoencoder
framework and showing its drop in performance Noise is added
to the feedback channel for a certain time interval Furthermore
they show that when this noise is removed the DRL system
automatically can regain its original performance leaving no
footsteps by the adversaryB Attacks Perturbing the Reward FunctionHan et al A similar falsication approach has been followed by Huang
and Zhu  Attacks Perturbing the Action SpaceThe adversary can have access to the actuators and might try
to perturb the actions taken Yeow et al Due to the difculty of obtaining the complex models for
cyberphysical systems for traditional control they are being
shifted to DRL Lee et al D Attacks Perturbing the Model SpaceThe adversary can have access to the model during or af
ter training Based on this access the adversary might try to
manipulate the model into learning the adversarial behavior or
might also try to extract the learned model and use it later for
attack purposes Behzadan and Hsu successful adversarial examples making deployed models even
more vulnerable to adversarial attacksHuai et al E DiscussionIn this section we discuss the attacks on DRL by categorizing
them based on the targeted part of the MDP The adversary
can target the state space action space reward function or the
model space based on the access available to the adversary When
targeting the state space the adversary can add perturbations to
the environment training data observations and sensory dataIn the case of perturbing the action space the adversary can
target the actuators In the case of perturbing the reward function
the adversary can perturb the reward signal or might ip it In
the case of modelspace attacks the adversary can perturb the
learned parameters of the model or might attempt to extract
the learned model which might be proprietary ie owned and
copyrighted by some organizationIn real environments the attacks that generate imperceptible
and natural perturbations are more practical than the attacks
that involve adding specially designed perturbations to states In
applications like autonomous driving getting direct access to the
sensors might not be possible for the adversary The only option
is to perturb the environment hence indirectly affecting the ob
servations actions rewards and policies The real environments
are often blackbox where the adversary has no knowledge of
the system being attacked and the number of queries is limitedThe adversary has to improvise to attack the system where the
target of the adversary can be to cause a drop in performance
of the system or to evade the system This puts forward a need
for queryefcient attacks similar to those proposed in Table I shows a summary of the adversarial attacks on DRIV DEFENSES AGAINST ADVERSARIAL ATTACKS ON DRIn this section we provide a detailed review of the counter
measures proposed to deal with adversarial attacks on DRFig 8 shows a basic taxonomy of the defenses that can be used
for securing DRL algorithmsA Adversarial TrainingAdversarial training includes retraining of the ML modeusing the adversarial examples along with the legitimate ex

distribution Although adversarial retraining can help improve
the robustness of the ML model the ML model can still be com
promised through adversarial examples generated through some
other methods The goal of adversarial training is to improve
the generalization outside of the training manifold Kos and
Song Pattanaik et al Behzadan and Munir robustness of DRL algorithms to both training and testtime
attacks and nd out that under the trainingtime attack the DQN
can learn and become robust by changing the policy They
propose that for an agent to recover from adversarial attacks
the number of the adversarial samples in the memory needs to
reach a critical limit In this way when the agent samples a
random batch from the memory it can learn the perturbation
statistics They also compare the performance of cid4greedy and
parameterspace noise exploration methods in case of adversar
ial attacks They show the cid4greedy methods to be more robust to
trainingtime attacks than the noisy exploration technique They
also nd noisy exploration techniques to be able to recover faster

environments are also robust to adversarial attacks that involve
adding noise to the state space Smirnova et al of highdimensional stateaction space This induces a dynamic
level of risk to stop the agent from taking suboptimal actionsTheir scheme is based on robust Bellman operators which
provide a lower bound guarantee on the policystate valuesThey also present a distributionally robust soft actorcritic
based on mixed exploration acting conservatively in the short
term and exploring optimistically in a long run leading to an
optimal policy The direct target in Tessler et al Kumar et al Fisher et al Pan et al This gives more options to the attacker
to perturb the environment hence serving as a strong adversaryThe overtting of RL policies to the training environments
cause them to fail to generalize to safetycritical scenariosWang et al Zhang et al Oikarinen et al Zhang et al D Adversarial DetectionAdversarial detection involves the detection of adversariasamples using a model especially trained to segregate the true
samples from the adversarial ones In this way we can disregard
the adversarial inputs without modifying the original model Lin

TMDPs is discussed as a future research pathE Defensive DistillationPapernot et al Recently Czarnecki et al Qu et al F DiscussionWe discuss the stateoftheart defenses in this section by
categorizing them into adversarial training robust learning
adversarial detection defensive distillation and gametheoretic
approaches It can be seen that most of these techniques are only
effective against the specied type of adversarial attacks and
do not provide any guarantees against other types of attacksMost of these techniques focus on making the DRL agentlearn a robust policy by use of different mechanisms such as
training using adversarial examples simulating minmax games
with adversaries using robust alternatives of MDPs etc These
techniques are more practical than the ones involving adversariadetection Due to the advent of new attacking strategies by the
day one can never be sure that a detection mechanism will be
able to detect the attack Furthermore it is worth noting that there
are very few defenses for DRL algorithms that do not involve
images as the observationsTable II summarizes key information of the proposed defensesfor DRL algorithmsV METRICS TOOLS AND PLATFORMS FOR BENCHMARKING
DRAs we have previously discussed DRL is different from other
ML schemes and only reporting the accuracy is not sufcient
to cover security aspects of the DRL schemes In particular we
need to consider the temporaldomain aspect of the DRL while
designing the DRLbased attack or defense Benchmarking the
DRL performance in attacks and defenses is very importantThe need for an applicable solution to evaluate the robustness
and resilience of DRL policies is not fullled by the current
literature There is also a need for a quantitative approach to
measure and benchmark the resilience and robustness of DRpolicies in a reusable and generalizable mannerThere are few benchmarks proposed but they are not sufcient
to cover the security aspects needed to measure the robustness
and resilience of DRL algorithms The few proposed approaches
are discussed in this section Behzadan and Hsu A TestTime Resilience and RobustnessTesttime resilience is described as the minimum number of
perturbations required to incur the maximum reduction to return
at time t while testtime robustness is described as the maximum
achievable adversarial regretThe following procedure is proposed to measure testtimeresilience for DRL algorithms1 Approximate the stateaction value function using policyimitation in case it is not already given2 Report the optimal adversarial return and maximum ad
versarial regret by training the adversarial agent against
the targets policy3 Apply the obtained adversarial policy to the target for sev
eral episodes while recording the return for each episode4 Report the average adversarial return over these episodes
as the mean testtime resilience of the target policy The method of measuring the testtime robustness is the same
as testtime resilience The only difference is that in the testtime
case we measure the average adversarial regret in place of the
average adversarial rewardBehzadan and Munir adversarial agent which is trained to drive the system into unsafe
states They prove the practical applicability of the technique
by comparing the reliability of two collision avoidance systems
against intentional collision attempts More recently Behzadan
and Hsu   Restrictions applyIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE VOL 3 NO 2 APRsequence of states while keeping its impact on performance
minimum hence saving from the unauthorized replication of
policies It is shown that unwatermarked policies are not able
to follow the identied trajectoryB Metrics for Attack PerformanceKiourti et al C Attacking DRL Tools and PlatformsDRL can be implemented using several available toolkits or
by using a combination of these toolkits Some of the ways to
implement DRL are the following1 OpenAI Gym 2 OpenAI Baselines implementations of RL algorithms3 RLCoach 5 Ns3gym platform All of these toolkits can be further combined with the toolkits
available for attacking DL VI OPEN ISSUES AND RESEARCH CHALLENGESWe identify the following major open issues and research
challenges in DRL techniques At the end of this section we
have also provided a roadmap to secure and robustify DRA Universally Robust AlgorithmsDespite the presence of the various defenses that have been
proposed the security of DRL algorithms remains an open
challenge The proposed defenses are only able to defend from
attacks they are designed for Hence they are still vulnerable
to attacks led by proactive adversaries MoosaviDezfooli et
al B Multitask LearningOne of the major challenges for DRL is learning to do
multiple tasks at a single time It requires a lot of samples
for this Currently proposed DRL algorithms can only learn to
perform one task perfectly They can be trained to play multiple
games like CartPole Inverted Pendulum etc but they need
to be trained from scratch for each game The algorithms are
expected to be scalable and be more generalizable so that their
learning can be transferred from one game to another Multitask
learning can help in making robust models that can grip the
true essence of the tasks and hence become difcult to be
fooledC Metrics for Robustness and ResilienceWe need to study why vulnerabilities exist in DRL models
and how we can mitigate them and train robust models A major
reason for the existence of these vulnerabilities is the use of DRmodels without the proper knowledge of the domain There is a
need to properly dene the benchmarks of DRL in terms of the
robustness of DRL against adversarial attacks Behzadan and
Hsu D System Design and TransferabilitySystem design remains an open challenge for the case of DRThere is a need to dene standards for system design for DRproblems as in this case the learning process is not supervisedSo the agent may not focus on the features that it needs to
learn This can introduce the error by mistake of the intermediary
and also even induce his behavior on the model We need to
have proper standards for designing the reward functions The
system design needs to be robust and resilient to adversariaattacks Ensemble of DefensesVarious ensemble defenses have been proposed for the case
of DL However they may not be appropriate to apply in the
case of DRL as it can lead to an exponential increase in the
complexity of the model which results in a signicant decrease
in performance In the case of DRL the model is making a
realtime prediction so a small reduction in the computation
capabilities may cause a great loss to the agent This remains
a challenge to defend DRL models using an ensemble with a
minimum loss of computationsF Model PrivacyPrivacy has become a leading issue these days and modeextraction attacks pose a serious threat to the integrity of the
learned models through illegal duplication A mitigation for this
suggested by Behzadan and Hsu  is to increase the cost of
such attacks or to watermark the policies We may experience
some randomness in the agent to save from such attacks but
that will incur an unacceptable loss of decreased performanceDeveloping techniques that can incur constrained randomization
in the model to save from such attacks is a promising eld of
researchG Explainable and Transparent DRFor deploying AI systems in realworld scenarios trust is a key
component The developer needs to be condent of the employed
models decisions Transparency ensures that the model is fair
and ethical while explainability helps to explain and justify the
models decisions There are a few articles that discuss explain
ability for DRL   Current techniques for explaining
DRL do not specically focus on targeting specic audiences
ie tester developer and the general public and there is a need
for the development of such techniques  Only through
their development we might be able to make DRL responsible
trustworthy and applicable in critical applicationsH Transfer Learning for DRTransfer learning I Roadmap Toward Secure and Robust DRThe ultimate goal of research in AI is to develop AGI which
can perform similar activities as humans in a more efcient
manner In addition to the algorithm being able to learn the task at
hand efciently it also has to be computationally efcient while
being robust to adversarial attacks Furthermore algorithmsneed to be sample efcient to be able to learn quickly in reaenvironments as there might not always be enough time to wait
for the algorithm to converge Meeting all these requirements
at the same time is a challenging task and one has to strike
intelligent tradeoffs between themIn this regard the rst task to achieve is the development
of sampleefcient and inherently robust DRL algorithms The
second task is the development of explainability techniques
which can explain the behavior of these algorithms in accordance
with human perception The nal task will be the development of
metrics that can be used to quantify the robustness and resilience
of these DRL algorithms Based on these metrics and the sample
and computational efciency one can then choose the most
suitable algorithm for the task at handVII CONCLUSIONThe broadening applicability of DRL in the real world has
directed our concern to the security of these algorithms against
adversarial attacks This article has provided a comprehensive
survey of the latest techniques proposed for attacking DRalgorithms and the defenses proposed for defending against
these attacks We have also discussed the open research issues
and provided the list of available benchmarks for measuring the
resilience and robustness of DRL algorithmsACKNOWLEDGMENTThe statements made herein are solely the responsibility ofthe authors

An inexpensive instrument not bigger than a watch will enable its bearer to hear anywhere on sea
or land music or song the speech of a political leader the address of an eminent man of science or the
sermon of an eloquent clergyman delivered in some other place however distant In the same manner any
picture character drawing or print can be transferred from one to another place  Nicola TeslaModern wireless and data communication systems are a combination of different distributed architectures
which involves many underlying applications technologies and networking policies The fth generation
of communication technology is expected by the year 2020 With this new networking generation different
allied networking and computational regimes such as the Internet of things pervasive computing ubiquitous
computing approximates computing and approximate networking is expected to contribute in building
towards the network of everything Cost of computing and networking hardware is expected to decay
exponentially and with that networking cost also decays rapidly This massive transition and new networking
regimes have got research community to think of new alternative networking designs for wireless and data
communication In this section we will briey introduce and discuss the issues in previous and current
networking architecture We will also provide a list of problems in current networking architecture This
section will also include the social and economic challenges for next generation networking architectureA Design Evolution of Wireless  Data Communication Networks1 Legacy Wireless Communication Network Legacy networking architecture lacks the ability of cog
nition They usually follow a strict rulebased policy in determining the allocation of spectrum resources
identication of transmission channel interference temperature and many other network related informationThese rulebased systems initially work ne for a small set of users with limited quality of service QoSrequirements but as the wireless network grows in the number of users and their service requirements
these strict rulebased systems with no cognition ability were not able to deliver the optimal performanceThe major reason for this failure lies in the ossication of the network design which did not allow the
transmitter and receiver to learn from the dynamic environment and results in bad network performance
poor QoS and wastage of network resources2 CrossLayer Wireless Networking Communication systems were designed in a strict layered approach
where each layer performed prespecied tasks and follows strict layering principals to perform these
prespecied tasks The major shortcoming of this design was the lack of the operational information
dissemination to other layers which is a major hindrance in fullling the necessary architectural design
requirements of wireless communication system Another reason for this failure was the timevarying nature
of the wireless channel To overcome these issues a crosslayer designing approach for wireless network was
used where joint optimization of networking protocols across different layers and improved coordination
among different layers was introduced Fundamentally crosslayer wireless network architectures are based
on sharing the knowledge of physical and media access control MAC layer of the wireless channel with the
layers above them This information sharing solves the critical problem of resource allocation in wireless
networking The major problem with this design approach is its lack of dynamic behavior adaption of
the wireless network user diversity and different QoS demands of users and this lack of adaption has a
negative effect on the tradeoff between performance and interoperability3 Cognition Based Networking The rapid expansion of the wireless communication and the Internet
has resulted in a complex heterogeneous design which requires the network to be capable of dynamically
adapting from the surroundings for intelligent resource allocation and interoperability The ossied legacy
layered network design and the stringently bounded crosslayer architecture are not able to meet the diverse
needs of the new era of wireless communication systems To meet these challenges the idea of cognition
is taken from psychology and implemented in wireless communication network design This new paradigm
was named as cognitive radiosa Spectrum Access  Utilization Before moving ahead with cognitive radios we need to mention
another major issue which causes the diversion from crosslayer design to a more intelligent cognition based
design This issue is known as spectrum access and utilization The electromagnetic spectrum is a scarce
natural resource regulated by governments The expected exponential growth in connected devices and
proposed small densely connected topologies for upcoming communication systems will have a disruptive
effect on spectrum allocation and utilization Similarly rapid growth in the adaption of new communication
technologies and reduced cost of access for personal and corporate use has raised serious questions about
the availability and utilization of electromagnetic spectrum Federal Communications Commission FCCpublished a report in 2002 which is considered to be a very rst document reviewing the 90 years of
spectrum allocation and usage This report characterized the potential issues in electromagnetic spectrum
allocation and usage  Utilization of electromagnetic spectrum is biased in terms of occupancy of
frequency bands in the spectrum when we sweep the whole frequency spectrum few frequency bands
are vacant most of the time few are partially loaded and rest of them are heavily loaded This uneven
distribution of frequency bands usage causes underutilization of the electromagnetic spectrumAccording to the FCC report underutilization of the electromagnetic spectrum will be the most signicant
problem in future communication systems Underutilization of electromagnetic spectrum occurs due to two
major causes namely traditional command and control procedures and xed spectrum assignment policyThis underutilization leads to a phenomenon known as spectrum holes A spectrum hole is caused when
the primary user a primary user is the one which buys the license form the regulatory body and regulatory
body assigns a frequency spectrum for a geographical area for a mutually decided time to which a certain
frequency band is assigned for a certain time does not utilize it completelyIn 1999 Mitola et al  proposed a solution to this xed spectrum assignment policy by utilizing the
spectrum holes for secondary users users with no spectrum license opportunistically this policy is known as
dynamic spectrum access DSA Opportunistic behavior involves sensing the surrounding environment and
adapting to the statistical variations to extract the best possible result This sensing reasoning and adapting
behavior is known as cognitive behavior By incorporating cognitive behavior Mitola et al  in the
year 2000 purposed a new paradigm of intelligent wireless communication systems called cognitive radios
which has the ability of sensing the statistical changes in incoming radio frequency signals and making
corresponding changes in certain network operating parameters This reasoning and adaptive behaviourhas two primary objectives highly reliable communication whenever and whereever needed and efcient
utilization of frequency spectrumCognitive radios introduced a sensing and reconguring approach in networking but this design approach
has some serious issues like detection of weak signals from primary users before sharing the spectrum
with the secondary user It required a tighter control over the secondary user to avoid interference and
this control has killed the whole idea of opportunistic networking To solve this issue a new intelligent
sensing algorithm along with customized transceiver was required Another major challenge is to manage
the tradeoff between the censored radius of the primary user and interference power to avoid the shadowingSimilarly dynamic nature of wireless channel and diverse QoS demands needed a revised rate and capacity
adaption algorithms for cognitive radios to work Cognitive radios proved to be a much better design than
previous crosslayer or legacy wireless designs but due to aforementioned aws in cognitive radios design
it was not very successful But it paved a path towards intelligent wireless networkingB Design Challenges for Next Generation of Wireless  Data Communication NetworksNow lets take a look on the issues in current wireless and data network designs Heterogeneity com
plexity and dynamic nature are the three fundamental properties of next communication generation The
communication architecture and the Internet were not designed to fulll these properties With the emergence
of new technologies such as the Internet of things multicore architectures and exponential social adaption
of these new technologies have rapidly increased the complexity of the wireless communication systemsThis has also increased the QoS bar for the applications to meet the QoE of the users With all these new
technologies wireless communication and the Internet have become a bounded closed loop system with
multiple tradeoffs and restriction to avoid multiple performance issues but now these strict policies have
become a bottleneck in designing nextgeneration communication systems1 Network Management As mentioned earlier there is an exponential increase in new innovative ap
plications of the Internet and wireless communication technologies but we are lagging behind in network
management and this is very alarming given the expected number of connected devices and their diverse
nature Network management has lagged behind in innovation curve because of fundamental strict bounded
internet and wireless communication system design To meet the challenges of nextgeneration communi
cation systems and connectivity requirements we need to think a new selforganized network management
systems2 Field of View of Protocols Wireless networks and the Internet employs multiple protocols to make
communication between transmitter and receiver possible These protocols are limited in their eld of view
and information sharing abilities with the complete network Whenever we need to integrate a new system
we introduce a protocol in the software and then keep on updating the protocols to x the raised issues due
to variable network conditions users QoE and security reasons Although we employee all these xes stiwe are lagging behind in user QoE applications QoS security etc This is because the problem does not
lie in protocols It lies in the protocols limited eld of view and their inability to model holistic network
systems Due to shortcomings the operators are not able to have a complete picture of what is happening
in the network This causes multiple technical issues at the operator which also reects on consumers QoEAlthough network function virtualization softwaredened networking and centralized control have offered
a solution of the protocol problem but apple does not the apple doesnt fall far from the tree These schemes
have their shortcomings and these shortcomings have their basis in rule based switching of SDN and closed
form of networking So in order to design nextgeneration networks we need to increase the eld of view
of a network protocol and rethink the restriction on the coordination among the networking protocols3 Measurement  Quantication Measurement and Quantication process of the wireless communi
cation systems and the Internet is of critical importance It is used for network planning and resource
allocation This process is usually decoupled from network control and performed ofine and this is a
major shortcoming in current network design Since most of the next generation networks are consideredto be selforganized they need measurement and quantication process to be realtime and distributed to
get a better view of network statistics to make an intelligent decision4 Knowledge Base Current wireless communication and data network architectures mostly use rule
based or threshold based decisionmaking strategies for their operation automation recommendation and
troubleshooting process Very few applications such as SDN employees articial intelligence AI for
decision making When we consider designing a nextgeneration communication network this lack of
adaption of intelligent machine learning techniques in current wireless and data communication networks
is a very alarming problem The adaption of AI in networking along with centralized control and strong
network analytics forms a knowledge base and provides the ability of realtime inference which is a
fundamental property of selfdriven future networks5 Tussles Current networking architecture has a distinctive perhop behavior for example routingThere are many parties involved in how to perhop behavior should look like These parties have their own
agenda or function that they need to fulll These agenda can be aligned to the network overall function or
these agenda have an adverse nature to optimize the network behavior to its own advantage without caring
much about the overall system This property is termed as Tussle  Tussles have its basis in different
social political conicting interests biased users preferences Internet service providers ISP monopoly
topological conicts competitive nature of the current networking business etc These tussles will act as
key enablers for rethinking the current networking architecture to support the future networking business6 Operators Wishes The service provider or operator in current wireless and data network architecture
is responsible for all the network planning decision making conguration operation  maintenance and
measurement  quantication Given the number of tasks and the expected number of connected devices
in near future this becomes a design aw We can leverage the advancement of machine learning formamethods programming languages big data genetic algorithms approximate computing and approximate
networking to ofoad the operator by introducing a sensing collecting adapting and reconguring property
in the network devices and the end users7 Routing Routing is a core part of any communication network which provides the information ow
in inter and intraautonomous networks These routing and forwarding algorithms are built on a strict non
adaptive policy which causes inefcient resource utilization Routing and most of the network components
follow strict rules this is because communication and data networks were not initially thought of as dynamic
systems Future communication networks are considered to be heterogeneous complex and dynamic so to
meet the requirements of the future networks a new selfaware and organized routing policy is needed8 Security Another aspect of current networks which will be a major concern in designing the future
network design is security The security in wireless and data networks is ensured by using hardware rewalls
encryption techniques and thirdparty inclusion The Major goal of security in the current design is to make
the best security possible to avoid any breach but best security is not the perfect security Best security
solutions which include a combination of encryption and anonymization makes operators job of network
management more tedious We need to revisit the tradeoff between security and network managementCognitionbased solution by developing an intelligent model using the big data produced by the network
can form a sustainable security solution which not only satises the privacy concerns of the consumers but
also makes network security management possible9 Optimization Premature optimization is the root of all evil  Donald Knuth
In current network architecture network administrator or network controller in case of SDN performs
networking parameters optimization operation to meet the diverse user demands and dynamic channeconditions Current networking architecture has a complex multi feedback loop alike architecture and this
property limits the eld of view of the administrator or controller and results in premature optimizationThis kind of optimization causes a disruptive effect on overall networking architecture10 Signalling Overhead A very imminent threat for the next generation of communication networks
is the signaling overhead this is a concern due to a large number of connected communication devices
forming a heterogeneous architecture To overcome this threat a new alternative intelligent signaling design
is required for future networks11 Connectivity vs Data Rate In upcoming years embedded devices will cost less than one dollar and
the number of connected devices will increase exponentially this will cause a unique problem where instead
data rate connectivity will become a major problem Future networking architectures must be able to deawith this issue intelligently by making a smart connectivity policy12Compromises  Tradeoffs The current wireless and data communication network design is a combi
nation of many tradeoffs restrictions and bounds which is a problem when it comes to building a dynamic
network architecture These compromises are made to enforce a strict policy to ensure better resource
allocation improved resource utilization optimal network performance and security The outcome of these
compromises is not as they were expected instead of producing optimal results in terms of avoiding
breakdowns security breaches information loss interference and congestion these strict rules has proven
to be shortcomings in designing a dynamic future networking architecture Hardware and protocol design
tradeoff latency throughput tradeoff the transmission rate restriction the minimum and maximum frame
size bound in TCPIP stack etc are the few examples of the compromises that need to be revisited and
improved for building an intelligent selfdriven networkC Social  Economic ChallengesTwo fundamental driving forces that had played an important role in the success of wireless and data
networks are social needs and economic growth These enablers are expected to be important components of
future networks Since the social and economic aspect of current networking architecture are key enablers
they are also considered as major challenges for future networks We will discuss these two daunting
challenges in upcoming paragraphs1 Social Challenges Networking is not about connecting devices that share information it is about
connecting people The Internet and other communication networks were designed on the basic principle
of sharing knowledge and meeting the social needs of the society As society evolves the networking has
tried to adapt accordingly by introducing different ideas such as congestion controls to dedicated systems
password protection to encrypted machines spam ltering to rewalls open network to regulated network
etc Given the social evolution these aforementioned ideas may not work for future networksFor designing new networking architectures the research community has to look into these ve fundamental social aspectsi Do we need to revisit the social human contract which talks about the political and moral evolutionof the human with timeii Do we need to provide cyber education to the community
iii Do we need to conduct social studies to learn about the communication demands and risks beforedeveloping new designsiv How to convince the community to utilize the network for economic activity
v How to settle on a less strict tradeoff on censorship and privacy for keeping the idea of Openness ofInternet alive2 Economic Challenges The relationship between alternative networking architectures and economic
viability is a very critical problem that has been ignored for too long in networking research The infrastruc
ture cost is decaying so does the communication cost how to build an economically viable new networking
architecture Economic problem will act as the most important problem and overshadows all the issues
given in IB There are ten fundamental questions that needs to be answered before designing the new networkingarchitecturei How to build an architecture that routes money packets are side effects
ii How to deal with the fundamental tussle between ISP and regulator to get to a solution of how toutilize the infrastructureiii How to achieve the optimal longevity by keeping the economic growth
iv Infrastructure should be owned by public sector or private
v What are the incentive that can be offered to the private sector to keep them interested in investingthe moneyvi There are about 5000 ISPs are they willing to invest in new architecture
vii How can we design a viable economic plan for bringing in the money from consumer Is buildingsmart markets zero ratings and service specic billing a appropriate solutionviii Should we put the regulations on networks and give its control to the state authorities to ensure trustguarantees and certicates How this will affect the economic circleix How to deal with local regulators
x How to deal with the tussle between network cost and computing costD Rethinking the Networking ArchitectureGiven the problems associated with evolution of networking architectures and all the design aws in
current networking architecture along with social and economic issues current networking architecture
will not be able to support the diverse needs of upcoming communication systems We need to rethink the
networking architecture which has the following properties t to its purpose secure resilient economically
viable manageable intelligent self organizing and meet the needs of society Design evolution aws given
in IA and issues in the current networking techniques provided in IB invites us to rethink the networking
architecture In this paper we will try to provide an alternative design approach for meeting the challenges
of next generation of communication networks by keeping in view the social and economic challenges
mentioned in ICE Organization of the ReportIn this report we will discuss the a detailed review of all the key components of an alternative networking
approach will be discussed which is based on improved cognition cycle Section II discuss the design aws
in the security section III highlights the barriers to better security design Section IV will provide basic
details of new cognitive wireless network design and improved cognition cycle Section V will conclude
the reportII SECURITY
In this section we have discussed the issues and challenges in security architecture employed in current
Internet and communication systems Current Internet architecture has a very poor security architecture It
is a combination of many compromises and tradeoffs Moreover initial security design assumption were
awed We will discuss these assumption and present how these underlying assumption resulted in a bad
security architecture but before that we need to look at the various denitions perspectives and players
involved in current security designSecurity in the Internet and communication systems had multiple denitions and they are all right in
their limited scope Initially security was dened as a system which performs only prespecied tasks
and avoid accepting or interacting with unsafe or vulnerable system This denition of security does not
fulll the needs of modern Internet and communication systems This is because the Internet or current
communication systems have multipurpose and multifunctional characteristics Prespecifying the tasks of
these systems will limit the utilization of these systems and this is not desirable Moreover there are manyunspecied tasks of the Internet and communication systems Security architecture was not designed to
meet these diverse tasks Designing a security architecture for upcoming generation of the Internet and
communication systems will be a very big challengeConsumers denition of security is very different from the aforementioned denition consumers do
not care about the specications technological advancement physical limitations of device etc They only
require a security which has negligible probability of evasion This makes security designers task more
difcult Another important aspect which is also relates with the consumer security denition is the tradeoff
between security and privacy it is a special case of the tussle between service provider and users This
tradeoff has not been handled properly in current communication and Internet design this section will also
discuss the issues and perspective solutions related to security and privacy tradeoffAnother denition of security is inuenced by the economics and politics where security is dened
as a cost effective system which is not only used for defence but sometime use for offence Different
couturiers have different legal social and economic laws and they inuence the security architecture by
imposing different restrictions and censorship This biased approach has caused a serious concerns in security
designing professionals Designing the Internet and communication system security by keep the incentive
for the investors and following the regional policies is another tradeoff that designers have to deal withThis section will also explains this important tradeoffThis diverse nature of security denitions and related tradeoffs depicts that the initial goal of designing
a general security solution was awed and we need to reconsider the security architecture that can handle
all the necessary security requirements of consumer service providers application developers and regionaauthorities To answer this question we need to understand two major concepts Flaws in previous security
design and Attack Characterization Flaws in previous security design will provide the initial design
perspective and limitation details Attack characterization is a process of learning the attacks dynamic
behaviour and analyze it to form a defence mechanism against itA Flaws in Current Security ArchitectureIn this subsection we will discuss the aws in the Internet and communication system security designWe will follow a layered approach to describe the aws in security architecture1 Physical Layer Links routers server and many other related hardware constitute physical layer and
it is highly vulnerable to the local and remote attacks using carefully crafted cyber tools and hardwareThis layer also contains hardware related information encoding and signaling transmission and reception
procedure and topological information of physical network design Security architecture must ensure that
this critical information stays private from unintended observer Channellinks are susceptible to eavesdrop
ping active and passive attacks adversarial attacks information theoretic attacks and many other related
malfunctioningPhysical layer security of wireless system is bounded by two major imperfection of wireless channenamely fading and pathloss There are other related wireless channel imperfections caused by nature but
current physical layer security design was not developed by taking into account these wireless channelimitations There are many security solution proposed to ensure security of the physical layer These
security solution are based on the coding theory key generation game theory information theory and many
other statistical and rule based schemesIf we look at the service model and functional specications of the physical layer they are best effort
and weak functional specications respectively Best effort and weak functional specication means that
hardware can malfunction attacker can tape the channel for information statistical approximation can go
wrong no service guarantees are offered to the users These weak underlying design assumptions are the
core reason of a bad security design for the physical layer These weak assumption raise multiple unanswered
questions like how to characterize the security how to decide on a physical layer security design given
the exponential raise in connected devices in upcoming communication generation the security of physicalayer is also related to the layers above how to ensure the security coordinationAnother related shortcoming in current wireless communication systems and the Internet which act as a
limiting factor in designing an appropriate physical layer security is the concept of security as a serviceAs mentioned at the start of the section that security has multiple dimensions and these dimensions wikeep increasing as we get into the next generation of communication In current security design for physicalayer the security is considered as a service where hardware is placed in secure facilities and many coding
techniques combined with encrypted key generation with trust sharing is used All these security xes are
rule based threshold based and contextless because the service base defence mechanism assume a uniform
threat model The major question here is how to develop a dynamic threat modeGiven all the aforementioned shortcomings in physical layer security we need to rethink the physicalayer security for next generation of communication systems We need to make the dynamic threat models
along with intelligent coordination among the layers This dynamic and robust physical layer security can
be achieved by rethinking the cognition cycle and building a trust hierarchy based cognitive solution for
physical layer2 Data Link Layer Data link layer is responsible of moving packets from network layers to the hostMany attacks has been performed and proposed in literature ranging from address resolution protocopoisoning to authentication attacks on the wireless users In wireless domain data link layer has faced many
security challenges such as hidden node attacks fake access point attacks authentication attacks MAC
ooding MAC spoong port stealing VLAN hopping etc Security in network is as strong as the weakest
link once the weakest link is compromised rest of the communication system will be compromised In
wireless communication networks and the Internet data link layer can be a weakest link This layer is
considered a possible weak link of security because this layer is not only attacked by the external attacker
but also faces the insider threat challenge where a rouge employee can share the insider information with
the adversaryWireless channel has its own characteristics and these are exploited by attackers in deploying data link
denial of service attacks where clear to send and request to send messages are ooded in the system which
ultimately results in degraded quality of service Similarly deauthenticaion attack where deauth frame is
spoofed by the attacker because of low security results in disassociation of the user from wireless access
point This attacks depicts a fundamental security understanding aw where the initializing frame security
is compromised to ensure immediate connectivity Another example of data link layer poor security is the
fake access point attack this attack is performed by spoong the wireless beacon frames and intelligently
crafting similar adversarial beacons and ooding the network with these adversarial beacons for the purposes
of denying the connectivity to the legitimate userAll the attacks and shortcoming explained are resulted because the current wireless data link layer model is
just an upgrade of the wired data link layer model with multiple compromises to ensure wireless connectivity
and availability Data link layer security lacks the dynamic adaption from surrounding environment due to
its static design and this results in awed security architecture for data link layer Since next generation
communication systems are expected to be self organized we need to reconsider the data link security We
need to design data link security as a part of a trust based system which has the ability to defend against
the adversarial and insider attacks3 Network Layer Network layer is responsible for packet forwarding and routing through intermediate
networks This layer offers no service guarantees as it is based on best effort delivery This underlying
service structure causes lack of trust and coordination issues in developing security of network layer for
next generation of communication systems Network layer security is designed using IPSec protocol where
encryption strategies are used to provide data condentiality and data integrity This security works webut putting more encryption to secure data is not a good approach because attacker information will also
get encrypted this reduces the probability of attacker detection and increases the complexity of network
trafc analysis at the service provider endAnother important task of network layer is routing the current routing algorithms are does not possess
the ability to learn from previous abnormalities and also lacks in technical security control Given the
expected heterogeneity and complexity of the future network these rule based and policy compliant routingalgorithms does not fulll the routing requirements To solve this problem a new intelligent realtime trafc
control scheme with trusted hierarchy support is required Tang et al All these architectures and designs have to face two major challenges namely trust hierarchy and migration
problem Trust hierarchy is a scheme where communication entities uses trusted authentication mechanism
via mutually shared like public key algorithm or trusted third party based authentication system In future
intelligent communication system this trust based network layer protocol is still an open research problemSwitching to new routing schemes with trust based authentication scheme at once will be very difcult at
the global scale This falls under the umbrella of social and economics problem We need a new sociacontract with economic incentives for the users and service providers to switch to this new secure intelligent
scheme4 Transport Layer Transport layer is responsible for end to end communication in the network This
layer provides logical communication between application process running on different hosts Transport
layer provides synchronized in order and guaranteed delivery with ow control and encrypted securityPreviously it is possible to build a closed form tractable model of transport layer behavior because networks
were simpler rule based and less diverse Future communication systems are complex and heterogeneous
building a closed form behavior model to predict the change in the network is not a tractable solution Current security architecture of transport layer largely dependent upon cryptographic algorithms Cryp
tography is a very powerful tool to ensure security but given the scale of the future networks this solution
will become a hazard due to expected diverse security needs in future Internet and wireless communication
systems As we increase the number of devices complex connectivity and multiple levels of security
requirements cryptographic algorithms turns all the attacks on the different planes into an attack on
availability and this is not desirable Cryptography algorithms will not provide unevadable security to
the transport layer because of awed endtoend service modeTransport layer also faces the session hijacking where an adversary hijacks the control on the session
between two nodes This is an attack on availability of the network and these attacks occurs because
current wireless and Internet architecture does not dynamically learn from the previous information of
session hijacking5 Application Layer Application layer is the only layer which interacts with the users and provides faccess to the user applications In future networks application layer is considered to be the most crowded
and problematic layer User application design and its complexity is only limited by human imaginations
this causes a very serious security threat to this layer The major security aw in application layer lies in
the diverse specications of applications and their security requirements There is no single threat modefor dealing with this diversity issue Another design aw in application layer that limits the security of this
layer is the lack of coordination with the other layers Applications designers are not aware of security
issues of other layers and this lack of coordination turns the diversity of application into a hazardApplication layer security is also compromised due to social and nancial conventions It is application
layer that denes how network will behave as all other layers are only responsible of their x actions
on the received packets Many of the security risks we face now a days are due to bad design choices
and compromises in application layer Since applications are designed to facilitate the user requirements
and this involves money Applications developer does not take into consideration the security architecture
of the whole communication or Internet stack Today applications are designed to have more powerffunctionality and features to raise nances to do this developer takes security risks such as using active
codes such as Java scripts and causes a communication and security risks This application layer design
approach is known as insecure by design and considered to be the root cause of the major security breaches
in communication and Internet architectureIII BARRIERS TO BETTER SECURITY
The issues in current wireless and data networks security explained in section II This section enlists the
major challenges that network community need to solve to ensure better security for next generation of
communication systemsA Self OrganizationSelfOrganization SO has been dened as learning from the environment and adapting the statisticavariations in input stimuli to achieve highly reliable communications whenever and wherever needed The
growth in communication devices data hungry application and diverse security requirements has changed
the focus of research community from static rule based security to dynamic learning security architecturesSince user behavior and user application requirements are only bounded by the human imagination the
underlying service architecture of current communication system is not good enough to cope with the
dynamic security requirements of these applications We need to build a self organization based security in
each layerto ensure a better security for next generation of communication systems The desired security
requires automated real time measurements and inference on each layer and adapt accordingly to ensure
consumers and operators trust on the securityB Tussles in CyberspaceCurrent communication and Internet security architecture has different stake holders with aligned or
adverse alignment of interests Current communication and data network security does not take into consid
erations these tussles Two Major tussles in security architectures are namely useroperator and governments
and security and privacy Any security architecture design for the future networks have to deal with these
tussles Design by choice modulerization and cognitive design are the way forward in dealing with tusslesDesign by choice involves offering more control to all stakeholders by designing an intelligent cognitive
security architecture in the tussle space 1 Tussle between user operator and governments This tussle describes the adverse alignment of goals
between user operator and government User want an unevadeable security operator wants more controon user trafc for QoS trafc analysis and other network performance evaluation where as government
want to impose their security policies and these policies are inline with their socioeconomic goals Current
security architecture lacks in the ability of dealing with this tussle Application of cryptography is a very
related example to this tussle as user uses multilayer encryption to ensure its security operator does not
want this level of encryption because this makes trafc analysis and detection of malicious user very
difcult Governments want a full control on user and operator operations to use security for user proling
intelligence tracking and other related tasks2 Tussle between security and privacy This tussle is a special case of useroperator and government
tussle This tussle has its roots is social behaviors Current security architecture of the communication and
data network was not designed by keeping in view the social needs of the consumer Consumer normally
confuses data security with privacy Data security is related to condentiality integrity and integrity of the
data whereas privacy is related to right of personal privacy regarding the storing and usage of the user
data This tussle has turned into an arms race where users are employing different security techniques to
keep their data private and operators are restricting them to ensure security of the network by detecting
DOS and DDOS attacks Another example of this tussle is the consumer proling by different operators
and consumer data selling to advertising agencies This has been a major concern in networking community
and network designers have to nd a balance between security and privacyC Lack of Systems ThinkingWireless and data networks were designed is based on a Lego approach of learning Where we optimize
the network operations as separate entities This optimization approach does not posses the ability of dealingwith the requirements of future communication systems because this independent optimization can cause
the unintended consequences on the performance of any other component in the system For example major
security problem in current wireless and data networks is due to the lack of coordination among the layersfor example to provide powerful functionality application developer does not care for the security issues
caused by the design choice made Similarly greedy capacity achieving coding technique at the physicalayer does not take into account the decoder complexity For future network security should be designed
as a system rather than as a serviceIV NEW WIRELESS PARADIGM
In this section we will present a new cognitive wireless networking design which employees self
organization and machine learning to overcome the shortcomings of current wireless and data communication
networks mentioned in section I This new design is based on the new improved cognition cycle which
not only incorporate the sensing and adapting from surroundings but also involves the knowledge base to
ensure systems thinkingA Improved Cognition CycleThe cognitive wireless network is motivated by the shortcomings of current networking architecture
previous crosslayer network design and cognitive radios design These shortcomings have their basis in in
creasing complexity heterogeneity and dynamic networking environments To overcome these shortcomings
cognitive wireless networks are expected to be selforganized in future communication systems by employing
new network design approaches state of the art machine learning techniques and improved cognition cycleThis selforganization can be achieved by introducing a learning and adapting mechanism in conguration
optimization and healing process This complexity driven approach set the basis for designing the underlying
theory of selforganizing networks intentdriven networks knowledgebased networks software dened
networks and many other intelligent networking architecturesCognitive wireless networks operation can be summarized in two steps namely cognition and recong
urability In sensing process cognitive wireless network sense for wireless channel statistics interference
estimation and event detection These sensed attributes are then used for building an articial intelligence
in the network Whereas recongurability stands for adaption of the intelligent decision Analyze the radio channel and spectrum usage from surroundings Intelligently recongure the network operation parameters to select the optimal frequency band fortransmissionSignal processing and machine learning techniques are used to provide cognition and software dened
radio is used for providing recongurablity Figure 1 depicts the new improved cognitive wireless network
cycle it also represents the core tasks of the major components and the information ow between these
components1 Radio Sensing Sensing It provides the details about wireless channel sensing network trafc statis
tics interference detectionestimation and observing an event The raw information gathered in sensing
process describes the characteristics of primary user spectrum Radio sensing is also responsible for
sensing the activity of primary users when the licensed spectrum is reclaimed This activity sensing
helps cognitive wireless networks in avoiding the interference and improve the overall endtoend
reliability of the network2 Knowledge Base Analysis  Storage In this step the radio network telemetry for the primary user
is performed which involves event correlation anomaly detection performance monitoring metric
calculation trend analysis network semantics and many other related measurements Knowledge base
also records all the decision made in previous cognition and recongurability cycles along with a set of
available actions based on operator policy to improve the endtoend network performance Knowledge
base combined with intelligent decision making act as a brain of the network which processes theFig 1 Cognitive Wireless Network Cycle This gure highlights the major components involved in the
cognitive wireless networkingsensed input and makes an intelligent decision Estimation and decision making is another important
component of the cognitive wireless network3 Estimation  Decision Making Reasoning This step involves the detection of spectrum holes based
on the knowledge base information gathered by sensing and processing the spectrum information of the
primary users Once the spectrum hole is detected a dynamic spectrum manager and handoff procedure
enables the secondary user to pick the best frequency This also involves machine learning for channeprediction throughput transmitter capacity or any other customized intelligent decision making With
the evolution of deep learning and other efcient unsupervised learning techniques estimation and
decision making process in the cognitive wireless network has improved and in turn improved the
overall reliability of the cognitive wireless network4 Wireless Access  Link Control Adapting Estimation and decision making section provides the
information of channel prediction based on spectrum holes transmitter capacity etc Wireless access and
link control section of the network implements the reconguration based on the provided informationA tighter power control is provided by wireless access and link control section in order to keep the
interference caused by secondary users to the primary users and the interference among secondary
users Similarly the competition for spectrum resource is also handled by wireless access and link
control section by employing different game theoretic approachesAnother very important element of the cognitive wireless network is spectrum mobility which ensures
the desired QoS of primary users mean while providing a resilient service to the secondary users In
cognitive wireless network spectrum mobility is dened as the process by which a cognitive wirelessnetwork user alters its frequency of operation for using the spectrum dynamically allowing radio terminals
to operate in the best available frequency band and in case of primary users reappearance ensures a
smooth communication to the secondary user with low latency during handoff process Spectrum mobility
and handoff process proved to be very useful in the multihop cognitive wireless network where we need
to relay and route information between dynamically changing channelsThe cognitive wireless network is a key enabler for nextgeneration communication technologies and due
to its wide range of applicability it is a hot topic for research in academia and industry It has many potentiaapplications in wireless sensor networks Bluetooth emergency wireless networks vehicular networks
smart grids machine to machine communication adhoc wireless networks and most importantly in 5G

In this report i have discussed the design challenges in wireless and data networks I have discussed
issues in the security of current wireless and data networking architecture I have also proposed an improved
cognition cycle which includes knowledge base to ensures systems thinking by incorporating advances in
machine learning and big data Future work will include the details of each block of the improved knowledge

In 2016 OShea et al15 proposed the idea of channeautoencoders which is an abstraction of how an end
toend radio communication module functions in real
world wireless systems Such a deep autoencoder
based communication model is seen as a viable alter
native to the dedicated radio hardware in the future 5G
and beyond networks16 Figure 4a depicts the concep
tual design of the channel autoencoder that we choose
as a deep UL model for this case study We assume the
model is subjected to an additive white Gaussian noise
AWGN channel and apply the parameter congura
tions provided in14 To perform the adversarial Mattack on the channel autoencoder we consider the
following threat model and compare the performance
of the model with and without attack We assume a whitebox setting where the adver
sary has complete knowledge of the deployed
ML model We further assume that the autoen
coder learns a broadcast channel The proposed
adversarial attack on channel autoencoder canbe converted into a blackbox adversarial attack
where the adversary has zero knowledge of the
target ML model by following the surrogate
model approach provided in The goal of the adversary is to compromise the
integrity of channel autoencoder and the suc
cess of the adversary is measured by the ele
vated BLER with improving SNR per bit EbNWe take the following twostep dataindependent
approach to craft adversarial examples for the chan
nel autoencoder1 Sample the Gaussian distribution randomly
because the channel is AWGN and use it as an
initial adversarial perturbation d2 Maximize the mean activations of the decoder
model when the input of the decoder is the per
turbation dThis produces maximal spurious activations at
each decoder layer and results in the loss of the integ
rity of the channel autoencoder Figure 4b shows the
performance of the model before and under the adver
sarial attack Moreover the gure suggests that
adversarial ML attack often outperforms the tradi
tional jamming attackssystem asSince the idea of channel autoencoder in a wire

In the nal case study we performed the adversarial Mattacks on an endtoend DRL autoencoder with a noisy
channel feedback system17 Goutay et al17 take the
same architecture we consider in the previous case
study see the section titled Attacking Unsupervised

mechanism to it as shown in Figure 5a The endto

are available in17 The considered threat model for this
case study is given as follows We choose a realistic blackbox setting where
the adversary does not know the target modeWe also assume that the adversary can perform
an adversarial ML attack for ntime steps The goal of the adversary is to compromise the
performance of the DRL autoencoder with noisy
feedback for a specic time interval The success
of the adversary is measured by the degradation
in the decoders performance during the attack

sarial examples which states that adversarial examples
compromising an ML model will compromise other Mmodels with high probability if the underlying data dis

performance of the receiver degrades from 95 to

to the integration of vulnerable DL models to the 5G

Toward Robust MLDriven 5G and

Robustness against adversarial ML attacks is a very
challenging problem We rst note that there does not
exist much work on the recommendations and guide

have performed an extensive survey of the adversariaML literature on robustness against adversarial exam
ples and showed that nearly all defense mechanisms
proposed in the literature take one of the following

of detecting many adversarial attacks In our previ

HIGHLIGHTING ADVERSARIAL ML RISK FOR 5G AND
BEYOND indicate that the representative MLbased
5G applications from physical layers are vulnerable to
the adversarial ML attacks the threat models exploit
the underlying vulnerability inherent to known DL mod
els in general For instance we were able to attack the
DRL autoencoder by exploiting the fact of transferabil
ity which is the rootcause that enables a same pertur
bation to fool multiple models Thus we draw attention
to the security landscape of 5G and B5G widening fur
ther from adoption of a plethora of DLdriven compo
nents substantiated through results from three
specic use cases related to 5G physical layerRecommendations for Designing and
Evaluating Defenses Against
Adversarial ML Attacks
Designing a Defense
Designing a defense against adversarial examples is a
very challenging task Many approaches for defending
against these attacks are available in the literature
but these techniques are shown ineffective against
newer variations of the attacks6 The following are a
few recommendations for designing a defensive inter
vention against adversarial examples A generic defense that can defend against any
type of adversarial attack is not possible So the
rst logical step is to understand the threat
model of the system for which the defensive
intervention is needed In many cases the adversarial examples are gen
eratedsampled from a distribution similar to the
legitimate data A preemptive data generation
process by using generative models and aggres
sive labeling labeling the preemptively generatedEvaluating a Defense
In the following we have provided a few important
evaluation guidelines for evaluating the MLbased 5G
applications against adversarial ML attacks These
insights are extracted from the Carlini et al19 and our
previous works6 Many defenses are available in the literature
against adversarial attacks but these defenses are
limited by the design of the application Using them
without considering the threat model of MLbased
5G applications can create a false sense of securitySo for MLbased 5G applications threat models
must clearly state the assumptions taken type of
the adversary and the metrics used for evaluating
the defense Always test the defense against the strongest
known attack and use it as a baseline Evaluating
for an adaptive adversary is also necessary Evaluate the defense procedure for gradient
based gradientfree and random noisebased
attacks  Clearly state the evaluation parameters accu
racy recall precision F1 score receiver operat
ing characteristic curve ROC etc used in
evaluatingvalidating the defense and always
look for a change in the false positive and false
negative scores Evaluation of the defense mechanism against
outofdistribution examples and transferability
based adversarial attacks is very importantAlthough these recommendations and many
others in61820 can help in designing a suitable
defense against adversarial examples but this is stian open research problem in adversarial ML and ripe
for investigation for MLbased 5G applicationsBeyond Vulnerability to Adversarial MAttacks

world 5G networks any time soonLack of RealWorld Datasets
Due to the dearth of openly available real network
data from the telecom operators a large amount of

ML research in the telecom domain stidepends on simulatedexperimental data that often
falls short of truly representing realworld randomness

In ML studies the accuracy of a model comes at the
cost of explainability The DL models are highly accu

why a particular output is achieved Explanation of a
decision taken often would be a critical requirement
in the 5G and B5G network settings especially
because many critical services such as transport sig

to be realized over the 5G infrastructureLack of Operational Success of ML in Real

A plethora of ML models exist in the mobile network

we perform attacks on the ML models running under
the ideal environment simulated or in favorable lab
conditions and still the victim models cannot with
stand the adversarial attacks as demonstrated
through our case studies In realworld mobile net
works the ML models need to be deployed and stay
functional under unforeseen random environments
leaving them more vulnerable to adversarial attacks
that are beyond what they are designed to be robust

Security and privacy are uncompromising necessities
for modern and future global networks standards
such as 5G and B5G and accordingly fortifying it to
thwart attacks and withstand the rapidly evolving
landscape of future security threats is of vital impor
tance This article specically highlights that the
unvetted adoption of DLdriven solutions in 5G and
B5G networking gives rise to security concerns that
remain unattended by the 5G standardization bodies
such as the 3GPP We argue this is the right time for
crossdisciplinary research endeavors considering Mand cybersecurity to gain momentum and enable
secure and trusted future 5G and B5G mobile net

work will motivate further research toward telecom

the middle east religious and racial violence episodes in Eu
rope riots and lynching in India and Pakistan the genocide
in Rohingya etc are a few of the horrific examples where
extremist ideologies on social media have resulted into real
world tragedies Governments and social media giants are
trying to deal with this issue but unfortunately there hasnt
been any notable success Extremism is a subjective term
identifying and quantifying it is an open area of research
because of its connections with various cultural religious
political and technological aspects Extremist content is

extremist ideas begin in the offline world schools theolog

optimization algorithms makes it viral This availability and
virality of extremist content increase online extremism and
in many cases into realworld extremism episodes Identify
ing and moderating social media content while preserving
free speech and privacy is a challenging task Solving
this problem requires content moderation techniques and
platformlevel policies The lack of an extremism detection
and prevention framework notably in India and Pakistan
is leading in the continual distribution of extremist content
via social media apps This work outlines a framework for
extremist content identification and mitigation The project

The search using the aforementioned strategy identied a total of
4384 articles After removing duplicate articles title and abstractFIGURE 3  The methodology for systematic reviewscreening the overall number of articles reduced to 384 A totaof 230 articles did not meet the inclusion criteria and were
therefore excluded From the remaining 154 articlesarticles did not discuss attackdefense for thirdparty cloud
hosted ML models and were excluded as well Of the remaining
articles a total of 31 articles are identied as relevant Reasons
for excluding articles were documented and reported in a
PRISMA ow diagram depicted in Figure 4 These articles
were categorized into three classes that is articles that are
specically focused on attacks articles that are specically
focused on defenses and articles
that considered both
attacks and defenses containing 19 6 and 6 articles each
respectively32 Overview of the Selected Studies
The systematic review eventually identied a set of 31 articles

without affecting the original semantics Using the results
the authors demonstrated that MLbased WAFs are exposed
to a concrete risk of being bypassed However this attack is
not associated with any cloudbased servicescid129 Authors in Apruzzese et al 2019 discussed adversariaattacks where the machine learning model is compromised
to induce an output favorable to the attacker These attacksFIGURE 4  Search queries used to identify publications to include in the

hosted MLDL models increased in the year 2017 and was at a
peak in the year 2018 and was slightly lower in the year 2019 as
compared to 2018 Also the majority of the articles during these
years were published in conferences The distribution of selected
publications by their publishers over the years is depicted in

Learning Models Thematic Analysis
In ML practice it is very common to outsource the training of

that provide high
computational resources on the cloud Such services enable
ML practitioners to upload their models along with training
data which is then trained on the cloud Although such
services have clear benets for reducing the training and

can easily be

compromised and to this end different types of attacks against
these services have been proposed in the literature In this section
we present the thematic analysis of 19 articles that are focused on
attacking cloudhosted MLDL models These articles are

Ycraftedadversariaimperceptible421 Adversarial Attacks
In recent years DL models have been found vulnerable to

Goodfellow et al 2014 For instance a decisionbased
adversarial attack namely the boundary attack against two
trained for brand and celebrity
black box ML models
recognition hosted at Clarifaicom are proposed in Brendeet al 2017 The rst model identies brand names from naturaimages for 500 distinct brands and the second model recognizes
over 10000 celebrities To date a variety of adversarial examples
generation methods have been proposed in the literature so far
the interesting readers are referred to recent surveys articles for
detailed taxonomy of different types of adversarial attacks
ie Akhtar and Mian 2018 Yuan et al 2019 Qayyum
et al 2020b Demetrio et al422 Exploratory Attacks
These attacks are inference time attacks in which adversary
attempts to evade the underlying MLDL model for example
by forcing the classier ie MLDL model to misclassify a
positive sample as a negative one Exploratory attacks do not
harm the training data and only affects the model at test timethe

SeedExploreExploit strategy for evading Googles cloud
prediction API considering black box settings is presented
in Sethi and Kantardzic 2018 The performance evaluation
of the proposed framework was performed using 10 real
world datasetsdatadrivenexploratoryattackusing423 Model Extraction Attacks
In model extraction attacks adversaries can query the deployed
ML model and can use queryresponse pair for compromising
future predictions and also they can potentially realize privacy
breaches of the training data and can steal the model by learning
extraction queries In Kesarwani et al 2018 the authors
presented a novel method for quantifying the extraction
status of models for users with an increasing number of
queries which aims to measure modelearning rate using
information gain observed by query and response streams of
users The key objective of the authors was to design a cloud
based system for monitoring model extraction status and
warnings The performance evaluation of

method was performed using a decision tree model deployed
on the BigML MLaaS platform for different adversarial attack
scenarios Similarly a model extractionstealing strategy is
presented by CorreiaSilva et al 2018 The authors queried
the cloudhosted DL model with random unlabeled samples and
used their predictions for creating a fake dataset Then they used
the fake dataset for building a fake model by training an oracle
copycat model in an attempt to achieve similar performance as
of the target mode424 Backdooring Attacks
In backdooring attacks an adversary maliciously creates the
trained model which performs as good as expected on the users
training and validation data but it performs badly on attackera















































































































cikFrontiers in Big Data   2020  Volume 3  Article Qayyum et a FIGURE 8  Distribution of selected publications by publishers over yearstwo scenarios were consideredinput samples The backdooring attacks on deep neural networks
DNNs are explored and evaluated in Gu et al 2019 The
authors rst explored the properties of backdooring for a toy
example and created a backdoor model for handwritten digit
classier and then demonstrated that backdoors are powerful for
DNN by creating a backdoor model for a United States street sign


outsourced training of the model and transfer learning where
an attacker can acquire a backdoor pretrained model online In
another similar study Chen et al 2017 a targeted backdoor
attack for two stateofthe art face recognition models that is
DeepID Sun et al 2014 and VGGFace Parkhi et al 2015 is
presented The authors proposed two categories of backdooring
inputinstancekey attacks and

patternkey attacks using two different data poising strategies
that is inputinstancekey strategies and patternkey strategies
respectivelythatthatis425 Trojan Attacks
In Trojan attacks the attacker inserts malicious content into the
system that looks legitimate but can take over the control of the
system However the purpose of Trojan insertion can be varied

stealing disruption misbehaving or getting
intended behavior In Liu et al 2018 the authors proposed a
stealth infection on neural networks namely SIN2 to realize a
practical supply chain triggered neural Trojan attacks Also they
proposed a variety of Trojan insertion strategies for agile and
practical Trojan attacks The proof of the concept is demonstrated
by developing a prototype of the proposed neural Trojan attackie SIN2 in Linux sandbox and used Torch Collobert et al
2011 MLDL framework for building visual recognition models
using the FashionMNIST datasetinuences the host mode426 ModelReuse Attacks
In modelreuse attacks an adversary creates a malicious modeie adversarial model that


misbehave on targeted inputs ie
predictable fashion that is getting a sample classied into
specic intended class For instance experimental evaluation
of modelreuse attacks for four pretrained primitive DL models
ie speech recognition autonomous steering face verication
and skin cancer screening is evaluated by Ji et atriggers427 Data Manipulation Attacks
Those attacks in which training data are manipulated to get
intended behavior by the MLDL model are known as data
manipulation attacks Data manipulation attacks for stealthily
manipulating traditional supervised ML techniques and logistic
regression LR and CNN models are studied by Liao et aIn the attack strategy the authors added a new constraint on fully
connected layers of the models and used gradient descent for
retraining them and other layers were frozen ie were made
nontrainable428 Cyber Kill ChainBased Attacks
Kill chain is a term used to dene steps for attacking a target
usually used in the military In cyber kill chainbased attacks the
cloudhosted MLDL models are attacked for example a highFrontiers in Big Data   2020  Volume 3  Article Qayyum et a level threat model targeting ML cyber kill chain is presented by
Nguyen 2017 Also the authors provided proof of concept by
providing a case study using IBM visual recognition MLaaS
ie cognitive classier for classication cats and female lionsand provided recommendations
for ensuring secure and
robust M429 Membership Inference Attacks
In a typical membership inference attack for given input data and
black box access to the ML model an attacker attempts to gure
out if the given input sample was the part of the training set or
not To realize a membership inference attack against a target
model a classication model is trained for distinguishing between
the predictions of the target model against the inputs on which it
was trained and that those on which it was not trained Shokri
et al4210 Evasion Attacks
Evasion attacks are inference time attacks in which an adversary
attempts to modify the test data for getting the intended outcome
from the MLDL model Two evasion attacks

watermarking techniques for DL models hosted as MLaaS
have been presented by Hitaj et al 2019 The authors used
ve publicly available models and trained them for distinguishing
between watermarked and clean nonwatermarked images that
is binary image classication tasks4211 Model Inversion Attacks
In modeinversion attacks an attacker tries to learn about
training data using the models outcomes Two modeinversion techniques have been proposed by Yang et a2019 that is training an inversion model using auxiliary set
composed by utilizing adversarys background knowledge and
truncationbased method for aligning the inversion model The
authors evaluated their proposed methods on a commerciaprediction MLaaS named Amazon Rekognition5 TOWARD SECURING CLOUDHOSTED

selected articles that provide tailored defense against specic
attacks and report the articles that along with creating attacks

Machine Learning Models Thematic

Leveraging cloudbased ML services for computational ofoading
and minimizing the communication overhead is accepted as a
promising trend While cloudbased prediction services have
signicant benets however by sharing the model and the
training data raises many privacy and security challengesSeveral attacks that can compromise the model and dataintegrity as described in the previous section To avoid such
issues users can download the model and make inferences locallyHowever

this approach has certain drawbacks

service providers cannot update the
models adversaries can use the modeto develop evading
strategies and privacy of the user data is compromised To
outline the countermeasures against these attacks we present

against the tailored attacks for cloudhosted MLDL models or

Machine Learning Model Attacks
In this section we present a taxonomy and summary of different
defensive strategies against attacks on cloudhosted MLDmodels as described above in thematic analysis A taxonomy
of these defenses strategies is presented in Figure 9 and is
described next521 MiniONN
DNNs are vulnerable to model inversion and extraction attacksLiu et al 2017 proposed that without making any changes to the
training phase of the model it is possible to change the model into
an oblivious neural network They make the nonlinear function
such as tanh and sigmoid function more exible and by training
the authors demonstrated
the models on several datasets

loss in the accuracyresults with minimaaddition they also implemented the ofine precomputation
phase to perform encryption incremental operations along
with the SIMD batch processing technique522 ReDCrypt
A recongurable hardwareaccelerated framework is proposed
by Rouhani et al 2018 for protecting the privacy of deep
neural models in cloud networks The authors perform an
innovative and powerefcient
implementation of Yaos
Garbled Circuit GC protocol on FPGAs for preserving
privacy The proposed framework is evaluated for differentFrontiers in Big Data   2020  Volume 3  ArticleQayyum et a DL applications and it has achieved up to 57fold throughput
gain per core523 Arden
To ofoad the large portion of DNNs from the mobile devices to
the clouds and to make the framework secure a privacy
preserving mechanism Arden is proposed by Wang et a2018b While uploading the data to the mobilecloud
perturbation noisy samples are included to make the data
secure To verify the robustness the authors perform rigorous
analysis based on three image datasets and demonstrated that this
defense is capable to preserve the user privacy along with
inference performance524 Image Disguising Techniques
While leveraging services from the cloud GPU server

adversary can realize an attack by introducing malicious
created training data perform model inversion and use the
for getting desirable incentives and outcomes To
modeprotect from such attacks and to preserve the data as well as
the model Sharma and Chen 2018 proposed an image
disguising mechanism They developed a toolkit that can be
leveraged to calibrate certain parameter settings They claim
that the disguised images with blockwise permutation and
transformations are resilient to GANbased attack and modeinversion attacksa525 Homomorphic Encryption
For making the cloud services of outsourced MLaaS secure

2017 proposed a privacypreserving
framework using homomorphic encryption They trained the
neural network using the encrypted data and then performed
the encrypted predictions The authors demonstrated that by
carefully choosing the polynomials of the activation functions to
adopt neural networks it is possible to achieve the desired accuracy
along with privacypreserving training and classicationIn a similar study to preserve the privacy of outsourced
biomedical data and computation on public cloud servers
Jiang et al 2018 built a homomorphically encrypted modethat reinforces the hardware security through Software Guard
Extensions They combined homomorphic encryption and
Software Guard Extensions to devise a hybrid model for the
security of the most commonly used model for biomedicaapplications that is LR The robustness of the Secure LR
framework is evaluated on various datasets and the authors
also compared its performance with stateoftheart secure LR
solutions and demonstrated its superior efciencyagainst527 Rounding Condences and Differential Privacy
Tramr et al 2016 presented the model extraction attacks
against the online services of BigML and Amazon ML The
attacks are capable of model evasion monetization and can
compromise the privacy of training data The authors also
proposed and evaluated countermeasures such as rounding



pathnding attacks however this defense has no impact on
the regression tree model attack For the preservation of

training data differential privacy is proposed
reduces the ability of an attacker to learn insights about the
training dataset The impact of both defenses is evaluated on the
attacks for different models while the authors also proposed
ensemble models to mitigate the impact of attacks however their
resilience is not evaluatedand528 Increasing Entropy and Reducing Precision
The training of attack using shadow training techniques against
black box models in the cloudbased Google Prediction API and
Amazon ML models are studied by Shokri et al 2017 The attack
does not require prior knowledge of training data distribution The
authors emphasize that in order to protect the privacy of medical

In the study by Salem et al 2018 the authors created three
diverse attacks and tested the applicability of these attacks on
eight datasets from which six are similar as used by Shokri et a2017 whereas in this work news dataset and face dataset is
included In the threat model the authors considered black box
access to the target model which is a supervised ML classier with
binary classes that was trained for binary classication To
mitigate the privacy threats the authors proposed a dropout
based method which reduces the impact of an attack by randomly
deleting a proportion of edges in each training iteration in a fully
connected neural network The second defense strategy is modestacking which hierarchically organizes multiple ML models to
avoid overtting After extensive evaluation

techniques showed the potential to mitigate the performance
of the membership inference attack526 Pelican

Hosseini et al designed two attacks specically to analyze the
robustness of video classication and shot detection Hosseini
et al 2017 The attack can subtly manipulate the content of the
video in such a way that it is undetected by humans while the
output from the automatic video analysis method is alteredDepending on the fact that the video and shot labels are
generated by API by processing only the rst video frame of
every second the attack can successfully deceive API To deaFrontiers in Big Data   2020  Volume 3  Article Qayyum et a the authors

The attacks presented in the selected articles have limited scope
and lack diversity that is they are limited to a specic setting and
the variability of attacks is limited as well However the diversity
of attacks is an important consideration for developing robust
attacks from the perspective of adversaries and it ensures the
detection and prevention of the attacks to be difcult The
diversity of attacks ultimately helps in the development of
robust defense strategies Moreover the empirical evaluation
of attack variabilities can identify the potential vulnerabilities
of cybersecurity systems Therefore to make a more robust
defense solution it is important to test the model robustness
under a diverse set of attacks62 Lack of Consideration for Adaptable

Most of the defenses in the systematically reviewed articles are
proposed for a specic attack and did not consider the adaptable
adversaries On the other hand in practice the adversarial attacks
are an arms race between attackers and defenders That is the
attackers continuously evolve and enhance their knowledge and
attacking strategies to evade the underlying defensive systemTherefore the consideration of adaptable adversaries is crucial for
developing a robust and longlasting defense mechanism If we do
not consider this the adversary will adapt to our defensive system
over time and will bypass it to get the intended behavior or
outcomes63 Limited Progress in Developing

From the systematically selected articles that are collected from
different databases only 12 articles have presented defense
methods for the proposed attack as compared to the articles
that are focused on attacks that is 19 In these 12 articles six have
only discussedpresented a defense strategy and six have
developed a defense against a particular attack This indicates
that there is limited activity from the research community in
developing defense strategies for already proposed attacks in the
literature In addition the proposed defenses only mitigate or
detect those attacks for which they have been developed and

in developing different attacks and the

popularity of cloudhostedthirdparty services demand a

systems as wethey are not generalizable On the contraryamount ofinterest7 OPEN RESEARCH ISSUES71 Adversarially Robust Machine Learning

In recent years adversarial ML attacks have emerged as a major
panacea for MLDL models and the systematically selected articles
have highlighted the threat of these attacks for cloudhosted MlDmodels as well Moreover the diversity of these attacks is drastically
increasing as compared with the defensive strategies that can pose
serious challenges and consequences for the security of cloud
hosted MLDL models Each defense method presented in the
literature so far has been shown resilient to a particular attack
which is realized in specic settings and it fails to withstand for yet
stronger and unseen attacks Therefore
the development of
adversarially robust MLDL models remains an open research
problem while the literature suggests that worstcase robustness
analysis should be performed while considering adversarial Msettings Qayyum et al 2020a Qayyum et al 2020b Ilahi et al
2020 In addition it has been argued in the literature that most of
ML developers and security incident responders are unequipped
with the required tools for securing industrygrade ML systems
against adversarial ML attacks Kumar et al 2020 This indicates
the increasing need for the development of defense strategies for
securing MLDL models against adversarial ML attacks72 PrivacyPreserving Machine Learning

In cloudhosted ML services preserving user privacy is
fundamentally important and is a matter of high concernit is desirable that ML models built using users data

should not learn information that can compromise the privacy
of the individuals However the literature on developing privacy
preserving MLDL models or MLaaS is limited On the other
hand one of the privacypreserving techniques that have been
used for privacy protection for building a defense system for
cloudhosted MLDL models

encryptionbased protocol Jiang et al 2018 has been shownthatisFrontiers in Big Data   2020  Volume 3  Article Qayyum et a vulnerable to model extraction attack Reith et alTherefore the development of privacypreserving ML models
for cloud computing platforms is another open research problem73 Proxy Metrics for Evaluating Security

From systematically reviewed literature on the security of cloud
hosted MLDL models we orchestrate that the interest from the
research community in the development of novel securitycentric
proxy metrics for the evaluation of security threats and moderobustness of cloudhosted models is very limited However with
the increasing proliferation of cloudhosted ML services
ie MLaaS and with the developmentadvancements of

development of effective and scalable metrics for evaluating
the robustness MLDL models toward different attacks and
defense strategies is requiredadversarial Mattacksattackseg9 CONCLUSIONIn this article we presented a systematic review of literature that is
focused on the security of cloudhosted MLDL models also
named as MLaaS The relevant articles were collected from eight
major publishers that include ACM Digital Library IEEE Xplore

developed a review protocol that includes inclusion and exclusion
formulas and analyzed the selected articles that fulll these
criteria across two dimensions ie attacks and defenses on
MLaaS and provide a thematic analysis of these articles across ve
attack and ve defense themes respectively We also identied
the limitations and pitfalls from the reviewed literature and
nally we have highlighted various open research issues that
require further investigation8 THREATS TO VALIDITYDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENTWe now briey reect on our methodology in order to identify
any threats to the validity of our ndings First internal validity is
maintained as the research questions we pose in Sectioncapture the objectives of the study Construct validity relies on a
sound understanding of the literature and how it represents the
state of the eld A detailed study of the reviewed articles along
with deep discussions between the members of the research team
helped ensure the quality of this understanding Note that the
research team is of diverse skills and expertise in ML DL cloud
computing MLDL security and analytics Also the inclusion
and exclusion criteria Section 23 help dene the remit of our
survey Data extraction is prone to human error as is always the
case This was mitigated by having different members of the
research team review each reviewed article However we did not
attempt to evaluate the quality of the reviewed studies or validate
their content due to time constraints In order to minimize
selection bias we cast a wide net in order to capture articles
from different communities publishing in the area of MLaaS via a

Generative Adversarial Networks For Launching
and Thwarting Adversarial Attacks on Network
Intrusion Detection SystemsMuhammad Usama Muhammad Asim Siddique Latif Junaid Qadir AlaAlFuqaha
Information Technology University Punjab PakistanUniversity of Southern Queensland AustraliaHamad Bin Khalifa University QatarEmail muhammadusama muhammadasim junaidqadirituedupk siddiquelatifusqeduau aalfuqahahbkueduqaAbstractIntrusion detection systems IDSs are an essentiacog of the network security suite that can defend the network
from malicious intrusions and anomalous trafc Many machine
learning MLbased IDSs have been proposed in the literature
for the detection of malicious network trafc However recent
works have shown that ML models are vulnerable to adversariaperturbations through which an adversary can cause IDSs to
malfunction by introducing a small impracticable perturbation
in the network trafc In this paper we propose an adversariaML attack using generative adversarial networks GANs that
can successfully evade an MLbased IDS We also show that
GANs can be used to inoculate the IDS and make it more robust
to adversarial perturbationsIndex TermsAdversarial machine learning GAN IDSI INTRODUCTION
In cybersecurity network anomaly detection is an important
task Rapid growth in network trafc and cyber attacks on
networked applications have made intrusion detection systems
IDSs a crucial component of the network security suiteGiven network trafc samples IDSs are expected to precisely
classify which sample is unusual and malicious without suf
fering from a high false positive rateRecent advances in machine learning ML and deep learn
ing DL techniques have revolutionized vision language and
speech processing The classication performance in these
areas has nearly surpassed the human level performanceMotivated by the success of the MLDL in these areas IDSs
have also adopted MLDL for performing classication tasks
to determine anomalous behavior in network trafc However
recently linear and nonlinear MLDL classiers are exposed
to be vulnerable to adversarial examples created for fooling
the classiers in reporting malfunctioned classication reportsSince IDSs have adopted MLDL techniques for classication
there integrity has also become questionableAdversarial ML examples are the worstcase domain shifts
of the input samples arising from a fundamentally awed
assumption in MLDL models that the distribution followed
by the training data will also be encountered at inference time
Which is not the case in the real world Adversaries exploit this
shortcoming and use local search combinatorial optimization
or convex programming to nd the adversarial perturbation
which compromises the integrity of MLDL performanceIn this work we utilize generative adversarial networks
GANs We employ GANs to introduce a strategic adversarial per
turbation in network data to compromise the IDS performance
and then to counter this adversarial perturbation we introduce
a GAN model in the IDS ML model to ensure robustness Our
results indicate that we can successfully evade MLDLbased
IDSs using the adversarial perturbation generated through
GANs Interestingly GAN technology cannot only be used
for attacking IDSs but also for empowering them Our results
show that by using a GANbased defense IDSs can be made
robust against previously seen as well as unseen adversariaperturbationsThe major contributions of this paper are We propose and validate a GANbased adversarial Mattack on a blackbox IDS Our proposed GANbased
attack is the rst adversarial attack that can successfully
evade IDSs while ensuring that the functional behavior
of the network trafc is preserved We propose a GANbased training mechanism for defense
purposes which improves the robustness of the IDS
against adversarial perturbations During the attack and
the defense procedures the functional behavior of the
network trafc is ensured by only altering the non
functional characteristics of the network trafcThe rest of the paper is organized as follows In the next
section we will provide a brief review of the related research
that focuses on producing adversarial examples for IDSs using
GANs We discuss some preliminaries in Section III in which
we provide the problem formulation assumed threat model
considered dataset and the constraint of preserving func9781538677476193100 2019 IEEE  Restrictions applytional behavior while launching adversarial attacks Section
IV introduces our GANbased adversarial attack methodology
and presents the results of our attack technique Section V
describes the details of the proposed defense mechanism
against adversarial examples and highlights that the proposed
defense increases the robustness of IDS against adversariaperturbations Finally the paper is concludedIn this paper we have proposed a GANbased adversariaexample crafting technique which successfully evades the
MLDLbased blackbox IDS and also ensures the preservation
of functional behavior of adversarial network trafc We have
also proposed a very effective defense against adversariaML examples using GANs to improve the robustness of the
MLDLbased IDSsII RELATED WORKIntrusion detection is a process of detecting malicious
activities in the network trafc Many MLDLbased intrusion
detection schemes have been proposed over the years  
 Most of the recent works in developing adversarial per
turbation for network security applications are focused on
malware classication and portable executable PE classi
cation Grosse et al The fundamental idea of the GAN is to generate adversariaexamples which have its basis like all generative models in
learning the true underlying distribution of the data There are
few examples where GANs have also been used for creating
adversarial examples in malware PE and IDSs Hu et al III PRELIMINARIESA Problem DenitionSuppose X is the feature set with n number of features
and let xi yi is a sample where xi  X is a legitimate
network trafc sample and yi  Y is true class label where
Y represent the number of classes The IDS aims to learn
a classier f  X  Y which is a true representation of
the incoming network trafc The goal of the adversary is
to generate an imperceptible adversarial perturbation  which
when added to a legitimate sample xi constitute an adversariaexample x and gets classied as f xi   cid54 yi We present
a framework by using GANs to construct x that successfully
evade a blackbox IDS We have also proposed a GANbased
defense to improve the robustness of MLDL techniques used
in IDSs against adversarial examplesB Threat Mode1 Adversarial CapabilitiesIn this paper we assume
blackbox settings where the adversary can only query the
IDS for related labels We further assume that adversary has
prepared an oracle by simultaneously querying the IDS Rest
of the information about the IDS is not accessible to the
adversary2 Adversarial Goal The goal of the adversary is to gen
erate such adversarial examples which evade and compromise
the integrity of the deployed IDSC DatasetWe have evaluated proposed GANbased adversarial exam
ples on KDD99 dataset widely used for benchmarking IDS
performance  The dataset consists of ve classes namelyNormal Probe DoS U2R and R2L representing the different
types of intrusion trafc for IDSs to evaluate Each record in
the dataset consists of 41 features 34 of them are continuous
and 7 are categorical features Onehot representation is used
to encode the categorical features Details of the datasets
features and its relation with the attack types are provided
in TableD Constraint of Preserving Functional BehaviorA very important constraint on adversarial ML examples is
to preserve the functional behavior of the perturbed examplesFor computer vision the adversary has to maintain the visuaappearance of the adversarial examples for language process
ing examples adversary has to preserve the semantic meaning
while creating adversarial text examples for malware and PE
adversary has to ensure that an dversarial perturbation does
not alter the executability of the malware or PE For network
trafc features the adversary has to ensure that an adversariaperturbation does not invalidate the network trafc features  Restrictions applyTABLEDIVISION OF THE FEATURES ON THE BASIS OF THEIR MEANING IN THE

trafc we need to take a step back and understand the feature
extraction method from tcpdump records Feature extraction
for IDSs from tcpdump records are extensively explained in
These four steps of feature extraction are as follows1 Firstly intrinsic features from the network trafc ow
are extracted These features are necessary for any
network trafc validity Any alteration in these features
will invalidate the network trafc2 Secondlytimebased features were extracted These
features provides timebased characteristics of normaand malicious trafc These features along with intrinsic
features are necessary for identifying Probe and DoS
attacks U2R and R2L attacks do not require timebased
network trafc statistics as these attacks are embedded
in contents of the packets So any change in the time
based features of the network trafc ow features wiinvalidate the network trafc characteristics3 Thirdly once the intrinsic and timebased features are
extracted from network trafc then content features
from ow trafc were extracted to detect U2R and Rattacks Content features are not required for Probe and
DoS attack detection Any alteration in these features
will not invalidate the Probe and DoS attack In this
paper we have used content features to generate adver
sarial examples4 Lastly hostbased trafc features were extracted these
features along with intrinsic and timebased features
are necessary for slowprobe attack detection Any
alteration in these features will not only change the
hostbased information but also invalidates the trafc

can lead to an instance of the Probe attack class being classied by the DNN
based blackbox IDS as Normal while keeping the functional attributes of the
Probe class unchangedrelation with the functional behavior of the attack trafc in
Table II Our GANbased adversarial attack only adds pertur
bation to content features to ensure at the functional behavior
is preserved This also highlights that to perform an adversariaattack the attacker must have complete domain knowledgeThis is also the reason why many adversarial attacks eg
FGSM BIM JSMA are not applicable to network trafc as
these attacks do not ensure the preservation of the functionabehavior of network trafc featuresAn illustrative example of how the functional behavior of
the network trafc features is preserved is presented in Figure
1 As the proposed attack is creating adversarial examples
of Probe class the adversary has to ensure that functionabehavior of the intrinsic timebased and hostbased network
trafc features are preserved Figure 1 shows that adversariaexamples produced by our proposed GANbased framework
have only altered the content features which fool MLDbased classier in classifying the Probe attack trafc as
Normal trafcIV GANBASED ATTACK METHODOLOGYIn this section we will provide the framework designed forcreating adversarial examples to evade MLDLbased IDSsA Adversarial Attack Using GANsGANs consist of two neural networks namely a genera
tor G and a discriminator D Provided the input examples
X  x1 x2  xn G tries to generate counterfeit exam
ples ideally from the underlying data distribution px that
deceives the D in accepting them as original samples from set
X Meanwhile D learns to discriminate between legitimate
examples from X and counterfeited examples from G This
learning process is formulated as a minimax game between
G and D The optimization function describing this adversariagame is given by max

and is usually dened to be a known and simple distribution
such as N 0 I or Ua b Training G and D is performed
by taking alternative gradient steps to ensure that G can learn
to deceive the D and D can learn to detect the counterfeit
examplesFigure 2 depicts the overall architecture opted for gener
ating adversarial examples The proposed GAN framework
consists of three components namely a generator network
G a discriminator network D and a blackbox MLDL
based classier f  The input xi  X is divided into two
portions namely functional and nonfunctional attributes This
division is performed on the basis of attribute contributions to
the functional behavior of the network trafc G takes non
functional attributes of the data as an input and generates
a perturbation  of the size of nonfunctional attributes of
the input Then we concatenate the functional portion of the
original trafc x and generated  this concatenation is given
as xcid107Gx The concatenated samples are fed to D which is
responsible for classifying between original and counterfeited
examplesD is trained to mimic the behavior of IDS This is ac
complished by feeding both malicious and normal trafc to
both IDS and discriminator and predictions from IDS are used
as labels for the training of D Contrary to D G is trained
specically on malicious data M such that D  a proxy for
IDS is fooled The designed adversarial loss for G and D are
provided in equations 2 andLG  minEpz log1  DGzxG

ples known to be malicious that are indistinguishable from
the legitimate trafc x and the goal of the D is to distinguish
between legitimate and counterfeited examples While training

construct the adversarial examples for the Probe class These
generated examples are subjected to MLDLbased blackbox

trafc is ensured by following the procedure provided in

adversarial ML attacksFig 4 Outline of GANbased adversarial training for MLDLbased IDSsOur proposed GANbased adversarial defense works by in
cluding a generative model in the MLDLbased IDS pipeline
and the IDS model is not only trained on the input data but
also on the adversarial samples generated by the generative
model Although this procedure resembles adversarial training
our approach is different since using a generative model such
as GAN in an IDS will introduce the robustness against both
known and unknown adversarial perturbationsB Results of GANbased adversarial trainingResults in Table IV highlight that the proposed procedure
of defending against adversarial network trafc has improved
the robustness of the MLDLbased IDS A clear improvement
in precision recall and F1 score in Table IV indicates that
the false positive problem associated with MLDLbased IDS
has also been taken care off by utilizing the proposed GAN
based adversarial defense against adversarial perturbations in
network trafc featuresFigure 5 provides a comparison between the accuracy of
different MLDL techniques before an adversarial ML attack
after the attack after adversarial training and after GAN
based adversarial training It is very evident from gure 5 that
the proposed GANbased adversarial training performed betterFig 5 Performance of GANbased adversarial MLDL attack and defense

evaluation parameters for the evasion attackFigure 3 provides a comparison between the accuracy of
blackbox MLDLbased IDS before the adversarial attack and
after it highlighting that the proposed GANbased adversariaattack compromises the integrity of the MLDLbased IDS
while ensuring the functional behavior of the network trafcDecay in the performance of blackbox MLDLbased classi

door air with chemical physical or biological agents modifying
the characteristics of air Most common sources of outdoor air
pollution include exhaust combustion from motor vehicles in
dustrial emissions forest fires livestock farming fertilizer and
power plants Major constituents of air pollution are Particu
late Matter PM Carbon Monoxide CO Ozone O3 Nitrous
NOx and Sulfur oxide SOx PM includes fine particles
suspended in the air These particles are usually 25 micro
meter PM25 and 10 micrometer PM10 in diameter Vallero
2014 These particles are a byproduct of combustion in mo
tor vehicles burning fossil fuels industrial processes and other
sources of smoke Other indirect sources are different chem
ical reactions of NOx and SOx in air Major health effects of
the PM pollutants are decreased lung function eye nose and
throat irritation difficulty breathing aggravated asthma non
fatal heart attacks and even premature deaths in people with a
lung or heart disease historyParticulate matter is a significant contributor to air pollutionAir quality is measured using air quality monitoring systems
AQMS which are technically validated by organizations such
as the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA
among others and are also known as referencegrade AQMSReferencegrade AQMS are costly and require a significant
amount of upkeep The PM25 values recorded by these
referencegrade stations are regarded authentic and are utilized
by appropriate authorities to issue health advisories In most
developed and underdeveloped countries there is a severe gap
in the installed referencegrade AQMS resulting in huge cover
age gaps and inconsistent air quality data Considering sparse Corresponding authorresources and the overburdened economies of developing coun
tries expansion of the current air quality measurement network
in a short time is a challenge On the other hand lowcost al
ternatives exist but the trustworthiness of their reported values
is frequently questioned Many studies have been conducted to
enhance the performance of lowcost sensors According to the
literature a mix of referencegrade AQMS and lowcost sensors
can aid in the development of urban cityscale measurement
networks while keeping the economic aspects of developing na
tions in check Gulia et al 2015 Usama et alAir pollution has emerged as a significant issue in the subcon
tinent Pakistan has recently seen a yearly smog season that
lasts from November to February each year Multiple Pakistani
cities have made the list of the worlds most polluted cities in
recent years Lahore the provincial capital of Punjab is one
of the worlds three most polluted cities The current state of
Lahores air quality puts the lives of the citys 11 million resid
ents1 in grave danger For the most part of the last three years
the air quality index AQI stayed between poor to severe The
AQI is a metric used to quantify the effect of air pollution on hu
man health based on limited exposure The higher the AQI the
more health risks there are In winters the smog fog and haze
results in the closure of the major highways airports and trans
portation incurring economic losses and social unrest Many
road accidents due to smog are also reported resulting in deaths
and financial lossesConditions deteriorated to the point where the government was
compelled to take action to protect the public from additionaexposure and pollution It includes the closure of brick kilns
in 2018 and the enforcement of conventional brick kiln conver
sion to zigzag technology with lower air pollutants Mukhtar1   In recent years the government has also issued orders
to shut down industries during the pollution season which has
had a disastrous effect on the economy In 2021 Punjab govern
ment also decided to close every Monday for nearly a month to
combat smog2 These circumstances need a thorough examina
tion of the citys air quality landscape In this study we focused
on the available PM25 data sources in Lahore Pakistan and in
vestigated the capability of the city to handle the issue of poor
air qualityAir quality and a citys capability to tackle air pollution are
quantified using three indicators 1 capacity 2 data andpublic awareness Here capacity refers to public and private
measurement infrastructure data refers to the public availabil
ity of air quality measurements to develop datadriven policies
and public awareness refers to the general publics interest in
the issue and how the public views the ramifications of air qual
ity issues In this paper we make the following analysis and
contributionsIt also reports that in a
persist Greenstone and Fanfew most polluted areas the loss in life expectancy can go up
to 7 years Greenstone and Fan 2020 An average citizen of
Lahore is expected to gain 53 years worth of life expectancy
if the World Health Organization WHO guidelines for PMare metEnvironmental protection departmentsagencies often collect
air quality data and health advisories are issued based on
predefined AQI readings Pakistan like any other develop
ingunderdeveloped country does not have an adequate number
of AQMS installed thus there is a scarcity of available air qual
ity data for most of the country Only four referencegrade air
quality monitors and a few lowcost sensors with publicly avail
able air quality data are available in Lahore We have confined
our investigation to PM25 because air quality data for majority
of Lahore is not accessible for other criteria pollutants Figure
1 provides the location of the referencegrade and lowcost air
quality monitors in Lahore city1 We have collected and prepared a dataset ofthe
PM25 measurement data from various publicaly available
sources referencegrade AQMS and lowcost sensors and
analyze it to further reflect on the robustness and authenti
city of the reported data from the public sources2 Based on the prepared dataset and the context information
of Lahore city we have developed an algorithm for recom
mending deployment positions of new air quality measure
ment sensors We have also reflected upon the validity of
these results and how more context information can yield
better sensor deployment3 Perception versus reality plays a vital role in swaying the
opinion of the urban public to adopt better practices for en
suring prevention against the hazardous effects of air pol
lution We have conducted a survey to gauge perception
vs reality of the air quality in Lahore and this work also
provides the crux of these findingsThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows In the next
section we will provide specifics on the air pollution data for
Lahore city as well as the sources Section 3 describes the pro
posed contextbased location recommendation approach for air
quality sensor placement and the results achieved Sectionwill discuss the survey conducted during this location recom
mendation approach to determine how individuals view the is
sue of air quality in Lahore Section 5 contains a brief yet
informative discussion on the validity of the acquired resultsFinally in Section 6 the work is concluded along with a dis
cussion on potential future directions2 AIR QUALITY DATA OF LAHORENeedless to say the poor air quality in the city of Lahore has

promise in sensor and actuator placement given the small num

placement research for air quality measurements They have
developed a method that uses attributes from the previously in
stalled sensors and historical air quality data from existing sta

Hsieh et al 2015 Hsieh et al used an affinity graphbased
technique to determine the optimal location for AQMS place

incorporates the historical PM25 concentrations meteorology

context is also incorporated in the optimal location selection
Hsieh et al 2015 Zheng et al 2013 The technique pro
posed in this paper is an extension of the affinity graphbased
approach where we have included various context features col
lected from Lahore city and used whatever historical air quality
data is available31 Affinity Graph Based Location Recommendation SystemHsieh et al used affinity graphs with a greedy entropy min

all known publicly available sources The data was cleaned and
preprocessed by following the data science principles clean
ing normalization outlier detection etc We have combined
the referencegrade AQMS data with lowcost sensors data to
further improve the volume of the dataset Gathering the con
text data for Lahore city is challenging as to the best of our
knowledge it is not publicly available We have employed Geo
graphic Information Systems GIS tools for collecting context
information such as commercial hubs industrial areas traffic
hotspots etc The meteorology data was available The road
network was extracted using satellite imagery and machine
learning techniques Figure 5 depicts the identified commerciahubs industrial areas drainage streams and traffic hotspotsFigure 5 Identified pollution hotspots in LahoreSince the proposed method is inspired from Hsieh et al 2015we recommend the interested reader to see Hsieh et alfor  indepth  details  on  how  affinity g raphs c an b e leveragedfor designing location recommendation algorithms  Our modeworks in two stages The first step is to compute the probability
distribution of unlabeled nodes using feature weight matrices
graph weight matrices and labeled nodes The entropy for each
node is computed in the second phase and the node with the
lowest entropy is marked as the labeled node and given the low
est rank for a recommendation for the installation of a new air
quality station The model is given a new set of labeled and
unlabeled nodes iteratively A more detailed description of the
AQMS location inference method in the following steps1 The input to the proposed location inference technique is
labeled node list labeled node air quality values histor
ical context features associated with each node unla
belled node list candidate node locations and features
associated with the unlabelled candidate nodes2 Based on the input an affinity graph is created and graph
weight initialization is performed in our case we have
initialized it with all 1s3 After the initialization we have computed the initial en
tropy with the uniform underlying distribution of un
labeled nodes and the feature weight matrix is updated
using gradient descent The probability distribution of the
updated unlabelled nodes is estimated using a harmonic
function and the entropy of the updated graph is com
puted4 The difference between the entropy of pre and post
graph updates is computed and subjected to a difference
threshold If the entropy difference is less than the pre
defined threshold value we ranked the node with the low
est entropy in the reverse order and assigned the node to a
labeled node predicted AQI assignment Whereas if the
entropy difference is greater than the predefined threshold
the algorithm will go back and update the graph and fea
ture weights and entropy is recomputed5 If there is no unlabeled node left in the graph the proposed
algorithm will output the N highestranked nodes which
in our case are the first nine nodes Since we have conver
ted Lahore into a graph grid the label of the top N nodes
will also provide their location information on the map6 We observed an inherent problem of clustering multiple
recommended nodes in this algorithm We noticed thatThe the conversion of unlabeled nodes from near the labeled
nodes converged to the point where none of the nodes
were labeled because the node with the lowest entropy was
tagged as a labeled node It is an issue when the number of
recommended locations is more than one Thus multiple
nodes were recommended in a cluster To tackle this prob
lem we introduced another loop to recommend only one
location in every iteration and use the previous recommen
ded location as a labeled node in the next iterationThe flow chart for the algorithm used for inferring the optimaAQMS placement is depicted in FigureWe tested the proposed algorithm with the available air quality
data for Lahore city and the collected context features The pro
posed AQMS location recommended algorithm provided 09 re
commended for new AQMS deployment The output of the pro
posed model for the recommendation of 09 stations for Lahore
city is provided in Figure 6 Referencegrade AQMS are usually
deployed by the environmental protection departmentagencies
which EPD Punjab will do in the future though for now we are
planning to deploy 09 lowcost on the recommended locations
to collect PM25 concentrations In future work we intend to
analyze the efficiency of the proposed location algorithm using
the reported data from all air quality measurement sourcesparticipants were between 1822 years old 67 of the re
sponses came from males and 37 from female participantsWe collected responses from 11 different public and private uni
versities in Lahore Nearly 73 of the responses suggested that
the air quality in Lahore ranges from very poor to severe 44
said severe and 29 said very poor Nearly 81 of the re
sponses suggested that smogfoghaze is their sensory percep
tion for air quality This response statistics also show that many
people think that air pollution only exists in winter and as soon
as the smog is gone the air quality is back to normal which is
not the case This response also suggests the lack of information
about air pollution among young people Our result also shows
that news mobile applications and social circles are domin
ant ways to get air qualityrelated information Nearly 15 of
people responded that they do not take any precautions to deawith air pollution 31 of the total responses suggested that
they have a respiratory condition and out of those 31 people
40 said that their condition aggravated due to poor air quality
in Lahore Lastly 38 of people suggested that transport is the
major contributor to poor air quality in Lahore The rest of the
people responded in favor of industries agriculture etc The
responses distribution about the potential sources of the survey
are depicted in Figure 7 More details on our survey and results
are available on our blogpostThis survey suggests the need to raise public awareness about
the dangers of air pollution and we suggest that including com
ponents on air pollution its causes and ways to deal with it
must be included in the school college and university cur
riculum We also recommend public meetings town halls and
seminars to increase awareness among people We also sug
gest the give incentives to the residential and commercial areas
where the air quality improvesFigure 6 Recommended locations for installation of air qualitystations yellow with the locations of currently installed stationsred4  PUBLIC AWARENESSFigure 7 Public awareness survey response on the perceptionabout the potential air pollution sources in LahoreThe  third  component  of  accessing  the  ability  of  a  city  to  deawith the air quality issue is its public awareness  Following thetradition in the literature Liu et al 2017 Pantavou et al 2017Lou et al 2022 Maione et al 2021 we have designed a sur
vey with only ten simple questions addressing the perception ofthe air quality among citizens and how this perception is builtand whether they are taking any measures to avoid detrimentaconsequences of the air pollution in Lahore city  The question
naire varied from general public perception of air pollution andpublic information sources to the selfreported levels of healthimpact due to air pollutionWe have  conducted  this  survey  from  21st  December  2021  to10th January 2022  We have received 177 responses from dif

to further the quality of sensing and source apportionment The
development of a public dashboard is prevalent where all public

made available to the public There is a dire need for academic
and industrial partners to further enhance the agenda on gath
ering reliable air quality data and using machine learning and
other predictions technique to prepare the EPD for upcoming
air quality challengesIn this work we also did our bit by designing an AQMS place
ment algorithm that incorporates the local context to provide
optimal location This effort is also a candidate solution to effi
ciently using the limited financial resources available Here we
also want to note that deploying 09 AQMS in Lahore will not
solve the data availability issue general public housing societ

that all government and private housing societies universities

and real air quality There is an urgent need to raise public

be placed on preventative measures such as wearing masks in

the sources of air pollution in Pakistan We recommend includ

emphasize the issue of air quality in Friday sermons and other
religious gatherings supporting public awareness events such
as seminars and town halls and offering incentives to the resid

social media applications and the Internet penetration the
government may easily overcome this challenge The ad

JADE DataDriven Automated Jammer Detection
Framework for Operational Mobile NetworksCaner Kilinc Mahesh K Marina Muhammad Usama Salih Ergut Jon Crowcroft Tugrul Gundogdu

The University of Edinburgh The Alan Turing Institute Turkcell University of Cambridge OredataAbstractWirelessjammer activity from malicious or
malfunctioning devices cause significant disruption to mobile
network services and user QoE degradation In practice detection
of such activity is manually intensive and costly taking days and
weeks after the jammer activation to detect it We present a
novel datadriven jammer detection framework termed JADE
that leverages continually collected operatorside celllevel KPIs to
automate this process As part of this framework we develop two
deep learning based semisupervised anomaly detection methods
tailored for the jammer detection use case JADE features further
innovations including an adaptive thresholding mechanism and
transfer learning based training to efficiently scale JADE for
operation in realworld mobile networks Using a realworld 4G
RAN dataset from a multinational mobile network operator we
demonstrate the efficacy of proposed jammer detection methods
relative to commonly used anomaly detection methods We also
demonstrate the robustness of our proposed methods in accurately
detecting jammer activity across multiple frequency bands and
diverse types of jammers We present realworld validation
results from applying our methods in the operators network
for online jammer detection We also present promising results
on pinpointing jammer locations when our methods spot jammer
activity in the network along with cell site location dataI Introduction
Jamming is the intentional interference aimed at disrupting
wireless communications services and as such can be seen as
a denial of service DoS attack   The use and sale
of jamming devices commonly referred to as jammers is
therefore illegal in many countries eg   and any
violations may result in imprisonment or fines eg  Nevertheless jammers targeting all wireless communications
technologies continue to be widely available and in fact
quite affordable see  for example The threat posed
by jammers to robust wireless communications including
on mobile networks is expected to become worse in the
future with lowcost and opensource softwaredefined radio
SDR platforms becoming easily available to arm malicious
actors In this paper we consider jamming in operational mobile
networks and in particular focus on the problem of detecting
jammer activity in this context The activation of jammers can
severely deteriorate the service quality in a mobile networkFig 1 shows the impact on selected celllevel key performance
indicators KPIs due to the presence of a jammer using
data from an operational 4G network We observe that the
jammer activation effectively shuts down the network for users
forcing uplink UL and downlink DL traffic volumes and
throughputs down to nearzero The levels of received signastrength indicator RSSI can also be elevated by over 20dB
100x increase with a jammer These results highlight the
potential risk posed by jammers to the robustness of mobile
networks This applies not just to currently deployed 3G and
4G networks that the society heavily relies on for personamobile communications emergency response systems and
public safety networks but also for future 5G networks that
aspire to support diverse use cases including ultrareliable and
lowlatency communications services eg connected vehicles
remote surgeryThe jammer detection in current practice however

a highly manual process that is costly and slow resulting
in degradation in user quality of experience QoE while
the jammer induced interference is detected and resolvedWhen significant service quality deterioration or network
outage is noticed which may be prompted by user reporting
radio network engineers manually examine large volumes
of multidimensional network KPI data to diagnose the
problem which may also require field testing Moreover
when jammer activity is intermittent it can be perceived as
a radio network problem and result in misguided network
reconfigurationsoptimizations Thus in current operationamobile networks according to the operators themselves it
may take days or weeks after the jammer activation for it to
be detected This suggests that jammer detection is a perfect
use case for automation in mobile networks that can not only
lead to savings in operating expenditure OPEX costs for
operators but also enhance user QoE Jammer detection is
also the first step that can enable further troubleshooting to
identify and pinpoint the interference sourceIn view of the above we aim at automated jammer detection
for operational mobile networks that can automatically and
quickly detect jammer deactivations then trigger alarms to
kickstart downstream resolution processes While this clearly
involves reliable detection of all kinds of malicious jammers
we also aim to detect the operation of other unintentionainterference sources eg malfunctioning devices DECT
phones that can cause jammerlike impact on the networkAchieving this goal however is hard as it requires addressing
the following challenges1 Any available groundtruth label information on jammer
activations to build an automated detection system may
be limited to small parts of the network andor short
periods of time due to the scale of the task and manuanature of the process So practical jammer detectionM























E9781665458221223100 2022 IEEE  Restrictions applyfor training the above outlined models This jammer agnostic
nature of JADE also makes it robust for detecting jammers
that may exhibit adversarial behaviors JADE also embeds a
mechanism to adaptively set thresholds to detect anomalies
thereby adjust the boundary between normal and abnormaevents To efficiently support the detection of jammers at
scale in realworld mobile networks across multiple cells and
operating frequency bands we employ transfer learning In summary we make the following key contributions We propose JADE a novel datadriven jammer activity
detection framework for operational mobile networks
III which addresses this problem for the first timeIt
incorporates two alternative customtailored semi
supervised deep learning based anomaly detection
methods for the jammer detection task along with an
adaptive thresholding mechanism JADE also leverages
transfer learning towards efficient modeling and ease of
deployability We extensively evaluate the JADE framework using a 4G
radio access network RAN dataset from a multinationamobile network operator IV Our results show that the anomaly detection methods
developed for JADE outperform a wide range of
commonly used anomaly detection methods when
applied to the jammer detection task and also confirm
the effectiveness of JADEs adaptive thresholding
mechanism We demonstrate the robustness ofthe JADE
framework powered by transfer learning in accurately
detecting jammer activity across multiple frequency
bands and diverse types of jammers We also present realworld validation results by
applying our methods in the operators network for
online jammer detection As a downstream use case of JADE we consider
jammer localization Specifically we demonstrate the
potential for pinpointing jammer locations based on
jammer activity detections in the mobile network
using JADE and combining them with cell site
location dataNext section describes our datasets and evaluation metricsII PreliminariesA DatasetsA unique and noteworthy aspect of our work is the use of
real 4G RAN datasets from a multinational mobile network
operator for our evaluations Overall these datasets outlined
below consist of about a million samples of radio network KPIs
measured at an hourly time resolution over several monthsTraining dataset This dataset contains normal data
collected during periods with no jammer activation which
is verified manually by the radio engineers from the operators
network It is used for training the two semisupervised anomalyFig 1 Impact of jammer presence on three celllevel KPIsa ULDL traffic volumes b ULDL throughputs and cuplink RSSmethods need to generalize well to be applied to bulk
of the data that is unlabeled2 Jammers can have very diverse behaviors Some jammers
once activated may stay continuously active while others
exhibit complex discontinuous activation patterns They
also differ from each other in their type eg military
drone specific jammer DECT phone the networks
eg 3G 4G and frequency bands they target In our
realworld dataset we have encountered jammers that
can affect as many as ten different frequency bandsMoreover newer types of jammers with a priori unknown
characteristics can emerge over time3 Jammer related activity needs to be disambiguated
from network KPI dynamics induced from normal and
expected behavior eg due to user mobility network
overload But this can be challenging for example with
active but distant jammersTo this end we present JADE which to the best of our
knowledge is the first automated jammer detection framework
for operational mobile networks By treating jammer activity
as abnormal or anomalous from the mobile radio access
network RAN infrastructure side JADE approaches jammer
detection as an anomaly detection problem  JADE is
envisioned for operator side deployment and considers cells at
each tower site as measurement vantage points It continually
monitors the time series of various KPIs at each of these cells
to detect anomalous behavior over timeAt the core of JADE are two deep learning based time
series anomaly detection methods that we developed they work
with multivariate KPI data at each cell In the first method a
multivariate long short term memory LSTM neural network
model tracks the variation of uplink RSSI observed at each
cell to predict its future value and detects an anomaly jammer
activation when the difference between the predicted and
the actual value is more than a threshold The second method
models multivariate KPI time series using a LSTM autoencoder
model and the associated reconstruction error over time is
compared against a threshold to detect jammer activationTo address the several challenges outlined above ie limited
labeled data ability to detect new and a priori unknown
jammer activity discrimination of jammer activity from normaKPI dynamics JADE operates in a semisupervised anomaly
detection mode   Restrictions applydetection methods we developed as part of the proposed
JADE framework This dataset consists of around 700measurement samples in total that were collected over a period
of three months from 266 different cell tower sites hostingdistinct cells operating over five LTE uplink frequency bands852862 MHz 17451765 MHz 17651775 MHz 1970MHz and 25002520 MHz Each sample is a timestamped

dataset corresponds to periods with jammer activation eventsSpecifically
three subdatasets each
corresponding to a different jammers activity over a 3 week
period These three jammers are arbitrarily named by the
operator as J16 J17 and J22 Among these J16 affects three
frequency bands 17451765 MHz 17651775 MHz 2500
2520 MHz and has a discontinuous onoff activation patternOn the other hand J17 and J22 have continuous activation
patterns which means once activated they stay active untithey are switched off J17 and J22 operate on 25002520 MHz
and 17651775 MHz bands respectively All these three sub
datasets are manually labeled by radio network engineers from
the operator with groundtruth on jammer activeabsent for each
sample These groundtruth labels are key to our study in that
they enable evaluation of different jammer detection methods
considered in this paper Overall the testing dataset consists of
255600 samples with groundtruth annotated KPI data KPIs
captured in each sample are same as in the training datasetEach of the three subdatasets contain data for at least 50 cellsFor the above datasets we have conducted preprocessing
steps to impute missing values with the average of neighboring
values and normalized each KPI value via minmax
normalization We did further feature extraction based on
the timeseries of the above listed KPIs following a similar
methodology to the one in  which led to 82 features in
all Besides the datasets described above the proposed JADE
framework and constituent jammer detection methods are
validated through trials on the operator side In IVC we
present results for two additional different jammers labeled
J23 and J19 encountered during the field trial period In the
case study on jammer localization based on jammer detection
events IVD we also use the groundtruth location data
for J16 J17 and J22 jammers along with the location data
of surrounding cell tower sites from the operator to assess
jammer localization accuracyB Evaluation MetricsHere we describe our metrics to evaluate the various jammer
detection methods developedconsidered in this paper TheseFig 2 Relative importance of different features KPIs for the
random forests based classifiermetrics are defined in terms of four possible outcomes that can
result from applying a jammer detection method which are TruePositive TP Jammer activity detected when such
activity is actually present as per the groundtruth FalsePositive FP Jammer activity detected when in fact
there is no jammer activity TrueNegative TN Jammer activity not detected when
jammer activity is absent as per the groundtruth FalseNegative FN Jammer activity not detected even
though jammer is actually activeAn effective jammer detection method minimizes both FPs
and FNs Two commonly used measures to assess the extent
to which a given method achieves these goals are Precision
and Recall1 as defined belowP recision T P
T P  F PRecall T P
T P  F NHigher values for both these metrics are desired A lower
value of precision equivalently a higher number of FPs leads
to an increase in OPEX to diagnose confirm and localize
jammer activity eg by field visits and testing when in
reality there is none On the other hand a lower value of recaequivalently a high number of FNs shows that the method
in question fails to detect all jammer activation events and
thus risks prolonged degradation of user QoE until the jammer
activity is eventually detected and stopped Given the above
having high precision and high recall are equally importantAs such we consider a composite metric called F1Score that
weighs precision and recall equally by taking a harmonic mean
of the two as defined belowF 1Score P recision RecaIII The JADE FrameworkIn this section we describe our proposed JADE framework
for datadriven automated jammer detection in operationamobile networks in detail By way of motivation we start by
examining the limitations of commonly used jammer detection
approach based on supervised classification thereby highlight1Recall is sometimes also referred to as Sensitivity or True Positive Rate  Restrictions applya challenge that an effective jammer detection method design
needs to addressA Limitations of Supervised Binary Classification ApproachA straightforward approach to jammer detection is to treat
it as a supervised binary classification problem In fact most
recent works on jammer detection  though aimed at
80211 networks take this approach and show Random Forests
RF Since we need a labeled dataset for training and testing
with supervised classification we use one of our testing sub
datasets for the J16 jammer outlined in section IIA for this
study Each sample in this dataset is a 9tuple KPI data labeled
as jammer activeabsent The dataset overall spans overcells across three different frequency bands 35 cells in 1745
1765MHz 17 cells in 17651775MHz and 9 cells in 2500
2520MHz It is a fairly balanced dataset with 60 40jammer active inactive samples We do a 7030 split of this
dataset to create training and test data for the RF based binary
classifier which leads to a test set with 11 cells in 1745
1765MHz 5 in 17651775MHz 3 in 25002520MHzWe first use the RF feature importance Fig 3 shows the box plot results for precision recall and F1
score metrics separately for each frequency band where the Jjammer operates with each box plot capturing the distribution
for the metric across different cells We observe that precision
and recall values are less than ideal and range between 07
08 and 055075 respectively The relatively lower recaresults indicate that this supervised classifier method errs more
towards missing some jammer activation events than causing
false alarms The combined effect measured by F1score is
worse with a median value between 05 andCrucially this poor classification performance is noticed for
cases with fewer cells and less data in the training datasetThis highlights a key issue with supervised classification based
approach to jammer detection  more and diverse labeled
data is needed Compared to getting normal class data it is
difficult and very costly to produce a large and diverse labeled
dataset with jammer activation events More data can be
available for normal periods as reflected by our datasets
where 700000 samples or at least 70 of the total data is for
the normal category but supervised classifiers fail to take
advantage of such dataFig 3 Precision recall and F1score performance of random
forests based supervised binary classifierB JADE OverviewThe foregoing discussion not only highlights limitations
with the supervised classification based approach but a key
challenge to be addressed in jammer detection method design
ie limited or no data labeled with jammer effect Another
challenge is that there exist numerous types of jammers and
each has its own different characteristics and impact on mobile
network performance eg due to affecting different sets of
frequency bands Gathering training data that represents ajammer types is simply impractical Moreover identifying the
decision boundary between normal network behavior and that
affected by jammer activity through the radio network KPIs is
challenging due to the inherent KPI dynamicsOur proposed JADE framework illustrated in Figaddresses the above challenges JADE is envisioned for operator
side deployment and considers cells at each tower site as
measurement vantage points to aid in online jammer detectionIt relies on continual monitoring of time series of various KPIs
at each of these cells and collecting this data at the operator
RAN data lake facility This data is then preprocessed to address
issues such as missing values by imputing with neighboring
ones before putting it through the jammer detection pipeline
in JADEJADE approaches jammer detection in an operational mobile
network as a timeseries anomaly detection problem C Deep Learning Models for CellLevel Anomaly Detection
Here we describe the two anomaly detection based models
we develop as part of JADE for jammer activity detection  Restrictions applyFig 4 Illustration of the JADE Framework1 Autoencoder AE 1 Autoencoder AE based Anomaly Detection ModeFig 5a illustrates the proposed LSTM autoencoder based
model that takes multivariate time series as input The core
idea is to encode each input sample using an LSTM network
and decode it using another LSTM network Anomaly detection
relies on the inability to faithfully decode the input sampleWith a sufficient amount of training data ie normal samples
the AE model learns to reconstruct the normal samples The
reconstruction error for normal samples will therefore be lower
compared to the reconstruction error of samples in the presence
of a jammerAs mentioned above the AE model has two components an
encoder and a decoder The encoder represents the input sample
in the latent space whereas the decoder aims to reconstructs
the latent domain back to the input sample The encoder in
our model consists of four layers The number of LSTM cells
in the first layer is equal to the number of features in the input
sample while the following three layers have 512 64 andLSTM cells respectively Then the decoder reconstructs the
input sample from the 4dimensional latent space The decoder
also consists of four layers where the number of LSTM cells
in its first three layers are 4 64 and 512 respectively The
number of LSTM cells in the last layer of the decoder equals
the input sample size in terms of features to the AE modeWe use Mean Squared Error MSE as a loss function and
trained the model for 20 epochs for every cell in the training
dataset We empirically optimize the hyperparameters with
grid search  We use RMSprop as an optimizer and
RELU as an activation function with a batch size of 64 Since
the network KPIs have inherent noise and variations we did
not introduce any additional noise in the input of the AE
towards better generalization2 RSSI Prediction based Anomaly Detection Model We
now present an alternative anomaly detection model for jammer
activity detection that focuses on predicting the uplink RSSover time considering that this KPI is seen to be the mostFig 5 a Autoencoder based anomaly detection model bRSSI prediction based anomaly detection modeimportant feature in our earlier study on supervised binary
classification based jammer detection Fig 2 The essentiaidea here is to train a timeseries prediction model that takes
as input multivariate time series of KPIs and predicts the RSSfor each following time step The prediction error is expected
to be low for normal samples as the model is trained with
data consisting of such samples But the presence of jammer
activity can yield higher prediction errors which can then be
identified as anomalies jammer activation eventsFig 5b illustrates our RSSI prediction based anomaly
detection model which leverages the stateoftheart LSTM
based time series prediction model architecture Our modeconsists of four LSTM layers the input layer three hidden
LSTM layers and one fully connected output layer The LSTM
cells in the input layer are equal to the number of features in
each input sample The following three hidden layers have 32
16 and 8 LSTM cells respectively The output layer is a fully
connected dense layer with a single neuron that outputs RSSpredictions Specifically our model predicts the RSSI for the
following 10 time steps based on multivariate KPI time series
for the past 10 time steps along a moving window Like in the
AE model the hyperparameters are experimentally optimized
with grid search RELU is used as an activation function and
the batch size is3 Single and MultiKPI models We consider two variantsof the above described models Single KPI model that considers only one KPI specifically
RSSI In essence AE and RSSI prediction versions of this
model deal with RSSI KPI time series Note that each sample
in the input time series to these models is multivariate with
74 different features due to feature extraction during data
preprocessing MultiKPI model that considers all 9 KPIs in our dataset
including other KPIs like uplinkdownlink throughput and
RACH success rate This is naturally a multivariate time series
with 82 features in each sample of the input time series again
due to the feature extraction stepThese single and multiKPI models allow us to understand
the added benefit of considering the various different KPIs
beyond just the uplink RSSD Adaptive ThresholdingThe two anomaly detection models described in the previous
subsection produce a reconstructionprediction error for each
new sample in a cell KPI time series But to detect whether
that sample is an anomaly due to jammer activity or other such  Restrictions appFig 6 Representative result showing the performance gain
with our Grubbs test based adaptive thresholding approach
compared to the stateoftheart n approachFig 7 Average RSSI distribution across cells using different
uplink frequency bandsinterference we need a threshold error level representing the
boundary between normal and anomalous samples Correctly
setting this threshold is equally key to effective jammer
detection It can be seen as deciding the tradeoff between
FP and FN probabilitiesDifferent approaches are taken for this thresholding in the
literature Some works do this manually relying on human
expert feedback to setadapt thresholds eg  but
this is unviable in our setting Feng et al Other works We instead take a tailored adaptive thresholding approach
on a per cell basis by examining the time series of
reconstructionprediction errors in each ceto detect
anomalies Our proposed approach to this issue can be seen as
an adaptation of Grubbs Test We start by defining two hypotheses H0 There are no
outliers in the data and H1 There is exactly one outlier in
the data We also define Grubbs test statistic to be calculatedfor each new data error sample YiGcalc maxYi  Y 
swhere Y and s respectively represent the mean and standard
deviation of the error data samples considered for outlier
detection Based on the above we detect an outlier Yi or
equivalently reject the null hypothesis H0 hypothesis of no
outliers if the calculated test statistic is greater than a criticavalue as defined on the right hand side of the equation belowGcalc cidN 
Nt2N N N  2  t2N N where N is the number of training error samples considered
initially t refers to the tdistribution and  is the significance
level related to the desired confidence interval If on the
other hand Gcalc is less than or equal to the critical value
then we conclude there is no outlier in the set of N samplesWe bootstrap the above statistic calculation with a series
of N error samples  from the training data and view it as
a window Then when we apply an anomaly detection modeone of the two from the previous subsection to each new
sample in the radio network KPI time series for a cell we
slide the window and include the new error sample new to
recalculate the statistic If it is greater than the critical value
the new error sample corresponds to an outlier anomaly and
so we undo the window sliding to ignore new Otherwise
new is now part of the set of error samples considered for
outlier detection In this work we set  to 005 equivalent to
95 confidence interval and empirically set N toFig 6 demonstrates the effectiveness of our above described
Grubbs test based thresholding approach with the n
approach for different typical values of n 1 2 and 3 for
the J16 UL1800 17451765 MHz test dataset and using the
multiKPI RSSI prediction based anomaly detection modeBox plots reflect the distribution of each metric across all cells
in this dataset These results clearly any single static threshold
is not effective generally while our adaptive approach always
yields the best performance We have observed similar
performance improvement with our approach with the other
test datasets omitted due to space limitations  Restrictions applyFig 8 Relative performance of AD models in JADE on the
J16 UL1800 17451765 MHz test datasetFig 9 Performance of baseline AD methods on the J16 UL
1800 17451765 MHz test datasetE Transfer LearningOur proposed solution for detecting jammer activity via
anomaly detection model with adaptive thresholding approach
thus far implicitly considered a single cell scenario In
practice however each cell tower site hosts multiple cells
possibly configured on different frequency bands Moreover
an operators network deployment may have thousands of such
cell sites But training and maintaining a per cell or even per
frequency band anomaly detection models is not scalable from
a deployment perspectiveWe therefore aim at a single cell and frequency agnostic
anomaly detection model one per each alternative discussed
in IIIC We cannot however base such a model by training
it on single cell or even single frequency band as different
cells and frequency bands have diverse behavior in terms of
radio network KPIs and jammer effect For example the RSSdistributions across cells on different uplink frequency bands
shown in Fig 7 clearly highlight such diversity So we train
our target cell and frequency agnostic model using normal
data from different cells and frequency bands To make this
training efficient we leverage transfer learning TL Specifically we train the cell and frequency agnostic modeas follows We start with a frequency band and a cell within
that band Once the model is trained with data for that cell we
treat that as the start point for training on a different cell from
the same frequency band reusing the already trained models
weights as opposed to starting from scratch Once the modeis trained across all cells of a frequency band then it is used
as the base model for training on cells for another frequency
band We repeat this process until we cover all frequency bands
and cells in the training data which ultimately results in the
frequency and cell agnostic modeIV EvaluationIn this section we evaluate the performance of the proposed
JADE framework using the operator provided 4G RAN datasets
described in IIA in terms of the precision recall and F1score
metrics defined in IIBA Comparative Evaluation of Anomaly Detection Methodsdetection AD model alternatives in JADE relative to
commonly used AD methods  Recall from IIIC that the JADE framework offers four
different AD models AE and RSSI prediction based models
each with single and multiKPI versions We train these models
using the training dataset IIA We evaluate using the JUL1800 17451765 MHz part of the testing dataset For
comparison we consider five diverse and commonly used
AD methods ZScore Local Outlier Factor OneClass SVM
Robust Covariance and Isolation Forest To make these baseline
methods work with our multidimensional KPI data we use
Principal Component Analysis PCA Fig 8 shows the performance comparison between the four
JADE AD models We observe that the multiKPI version of AE
based AD model performs worse than the other three models
especially in terms of recall However the single KPI version
specifically RSSI of the AE model relatively performs much
better We attribute this to the characteristics of KPIs other
than RSSI that allow reconstruction even in jammer presence
resulting in some jammer activations going undetected RSSprediction based AD models both perform well with higher
than 09 values in all three metrics The multiKPI version
of RSSI prediction based model offers the best performance
overall which suggests that considering all KPIs is beneficiaalthough marginally Relatively the baseline methods perform
quite poorly with values for all metrics less than 06 which is
no better than the random guess based on the known probability
of jammer activation events in the test dataset as prior FigThese results provide a convincing justification for developing
tailored AD methods for KPI based jammer detection as we
do in JADEB Robustness across Diverse Frequencies  Jammer Types
So far we have considered the JADE performance on one
uplink frequency band J16 UL1800 and with jammer type
J16 Here we evaluate across different frequency bands
and jammer types to assess its robustness For this study
we consider the best performing model from the previous
experiment as the JADE AD model  the multiKPI version
of RSSI prediction based AD modeIn the previous section we have already presented evaluation
results that show the effectiveness of the adaptive thresholding
mechanism in JADE Here we evaluate the different anomalyWe first compare the jammer detection performance between
frequencyspecific and frequencyagnostic versions of the
chosen JADE AD model on different frequencies that J  Restrictions applyFig 10 The performance of multiKPI version of RSSprediction based AD model in JADE on different J16 frequency

JADE AD model on J17 and J22 part of the testing datasetFig 11 Training time gain from using TL to train the frequency
agnostic multiKPI RSSI prediction based AD modeFig 13 Operatorside field validation with J23 jammerjammer operates on The frequencyagnostic version is obtained
with TL based training as described in IIIE Results shown
in Fig 10 indicate that the frequencyagnostic model though
marginally worse than its frequencyspecific counterparts yields
greater than 09 value for all metrics in more than 90 of the
cells The training time from using TL relative to not using it
is shown in Fig 11 which clearly demonstrates the training
efficiency gain that TL providesTo study robustness of JADE jammer detection performance
we apply the TL based frequencyagnostic model as in the
previous experiment on J17 and J22 parts of the testing datasetResults shown in Fig 12 clearly confirm the effectiveness
of JADE for these other jammer types The root of the
robustness property of JADE lies in its design choice to rely
on semisupervised form of anomaly detection training only
on normal dataC Field ValidationSo far our evaluation of JADE performance was based on
operator provided data labeled with groundtruth on jammer
activity ie the testing dataset in IIA We now present
results validating JADE performance in the field at the operator
side For this purpose we provided the radio network engineers
at the operator with the implementation of JADEs TL based
frequencyagnostic AD model as in the last experiment It was
used to reliably detect a different type of jammer J23 with
discontinuous activation pattern as shown in FigJADE was also used at the operator side to detect a military
grade jammer J19 targeting different uplink frequencies Due
to the complex nature of this jammer activity it was not
practical like with J23 to manually label the groundtruth
by the operators radio engineers Nevertheless we visually
demonstrate in Fig 14 how JADE is able to detect jammer
activity on a sample cell affected by this jammer During thefield trial period JADE was also used to detect jammerlike
activity that was eventually diagnosed to be due to a hardware
related problem see Fig 15 which shows the versatility of
our JADE approach to detect both intentional and unintentionainterference behavior affecting mobile network operationsD Jammer Localization Case StudyHere we briefly discuss a case study for JADE on jammer
localization The idea is to use the jammer detection results with
JADE in conjunction with cell site location data to estimate a
jammers location Jammer localization is a kind of transmitter
localization problem as cell sites surrounding a jammer detect
its activity with JADE as receivers and it can be localized
based on sensed signals at those sitesAs our purpose here is not on jammer localization algorithm
design per se but rather on showing the usefulness of JADE for
such downstream task we consider three most commonly used
transmitter localization algorithms  max RSSI centroid and
weighted centroid With max RSSI the location of the cell site
where jammer is detected with max RSSI is taken as jammers
location estimate With weighted centroid RSSI weightedgeometric center of cell site locations that detect the jammer
is estimated as the jammer location We use the groundtruth
jammer locations provided by the operator to calculate location
estimation errors as Euclidean distance between groundtruth
and estimated locationsFig 16a shows the obtained results for J16 J17 and Jjammers in our testing dataset while Fig 16b zooms in on
the results for J17 case Even with these commonly used
localization algorithms we find that jammers can be localized
within a few hundred meters of the groundtruth which is
sufficient in practice for radio engineers to pinpoint the source
of jamming activity Between the three jammers considered
J16 is located in the country side with sparser mobile network  Restrictions applyFig 14 Detection of J19 military jammer activity on a sample
cell with JADEFig 15 Detection of hardware induced interference with JADE

considerable attention in the research literature The earlier

contrast to our focus on jammer detection in operationamobile networks these works concentrate on highlighting
vulnerabilities of the LTE system to jamming attacks and
proposing mitigation methods We are unaware of any previous work thatleverages
KPI data to detect jammers in mobile networks by treating
them as anomalies or otherwise But there exist works in
mobile networks and beyond that use KPI data for anomaly
detection    While  Fig 16 a Jammer localization errors with different algorithms

monitoring perspective  VI ConclusionsWe have presented JADE an online framework for jammer
activity detection in operational mobile networks At its core
the JADE framework consists of deep learning based semi
supervised anomaly detection models that solely rely on
normal training data Also JADE incorporates an adaptive
mechanism for addressing the thresholding issue for cellleveanomaly detection Moreover the JADE framework utilizes
transfer learning to enable itself to scalably work across
many cells and multiple frequency bands We have evaluated
the JADE framework on a 4G RAN dataset provided by a
multinational mobile network operator with jammer activation
events labeled for different types of jammers Field validation
is also conducted and it shows the effectiveness of the JADE
framework in the wild Lastly we also provide promising results

Adaptive PHY Layer Transmission Parameters
Selection for LoRaWANInaam Ilahi Muhammad Usama Muhammad Omer Farooq Muhammad Umar Janjua and Junaid Qadir
Information Technology University Lahore Pakistan
Department of Systems and Computer Engineering Carleton University CanadaAbstract The performance of denselydeployed lowpower
widearea networks LPWANs can signicantly deteriorate due
to packets collisions and one of the main reasons for that is
the rulebased PHY layer transmission parameters assignment
algorithms LoRaWAN is a leading LPWAN technology where
LoRa serves as the physical layer Here we propose and evaluate a
deep reinforcement learning DRLbased PHY layer transmission
parameter assignment algorithm for LoRaWAN Our algorithm
ensures fewer collisions and better network performance com
pared to the existing stateoftheart PHY layer transmission
parameter assignment algorithms for LoRaWAN Our algorithm
outperforms the state of the art learningbased technique achieving
up to 500 improvement of PDR in some casesI INTRODUCTIONOver the next few years the Internet of things IoT networks
are expected to grow exponentially Most IoT end devices
EDs are expected to be i lowcost ii longrange and
iii ultralowpower These EDs will provide vital information
for intelligent decision making in many smart applications in
diverse elds such as healthcare systems inventory manage
ment and smart parking The large number of EDs deployed in
such networks poses signicant challenges such as low packet
delivery ratio PDR and high overall power consumption Due
to these challenges there is a need for an effective commu
nication technique that can enable simultaneous transmissions
from several devices while i reducing packet collisions and
ii keeping power consumption lowLongrange LoRa is a lowpower wideareanetwork LP
WAN protocol that enables multiple simultaneous transmis
sions through customization of PHY layer transmission param
eters LoRaWAN A decision of selecting an appropriate PHY layer transmis
sion parameter such as spreading factor channel frequency andpower is impacted by a number of factors A couple of most
important factors in this regard are i channel condition and
ii distance of an ED from a gateway It is a wellknown fact
that interference and data trafc load is not constant hence the
channel condition is variable with respect to time Hence there
is an absolute need for a proactive intelligent and adaptive
PHY layer transmission parameter adjustment algorithm for a
LoRaWAN network Hence here we present a networkaware
DRL framework for EDs PHY layer parameters selection
with the aim of maximizing PDR and lowering the power
consumptionThe following are our major contributions We have presented a DRLbased adaptive PHY layer
transmission parameters selection algorithm for LoRa
based EDs We perform performance evaluation of our algorithm
under different environment settings and show that our
proposed algorithm shows an improvement of more than
500 of PDR upon the learning based technique in some
cases while being adaptive at the same timeA LoRa NetworksII BACKGROUNDLoRa utilizes the chirp spread spectrum CSS technique for
encoding signals into chirp pulses spread over a wide spectrumCSS enables longrange communication with robustness against
interference and noise while keeping the datarate low LoRa
allows the selection of different PHY layer transmission param
eters spreading factor coding rate bandwidth frequency and
power for each device The values of these parameters affect
communication range data rate resilience against interference
and a receivers ability to decode the signal In LoRa a
transceiver can select a bandwidth BW in the rangeto 500 kHz and mostly a LoRa transceiver operates atkHz 250 kHz or 500 kHz Spreading factor SF denes
the ratio between the symbol rate and the chirp rate LoRa
provides seven SF rates to choose from SF6 to SF12 Coding
rate CR denes the level of protection against interferenceLoRa denes four coding rates8  A LoRa radio can
transmit between 4 to 20 dBm in 1 dB steps However due
to hardware limitations the mentioned range is mostly limited

SELECTION ALGORITHMTo the best of the authors knowledge there is no DRLbased
solution available in the literature for PHY layer transmission
parameter adaption that assures minimalist collisions in a LoRa
based networkA Problem FormulationWe modethe LoRa network with a total k LoRa EDs
in a network and with all EDs being within the range of
a LoRaWAN gateway The algorithm is centralized with a
DDQN being run on the gateway The gateway is not limited
in hardware and power resources hence is able to efciently
run a DDQN The whole operation is formulated as a Markov
decision process MDP where s denotes the state of the
environment allocated actions distance from gateway a
denotes the action the combination of SF and power proposed
by the DDQN and r denotes the reward at a timestep The
goal of the agent is to propose action in order to minimize the
collisions while keeping power usage as low as possibleB RewardCost FunctionThe proposed reward function takes into account the PDR
packet airtime and power usage of an ED The rewardcost
function is given in Equation 1 In the equation P DRt and
att represent PDR and airtime in seconds respectively at time
instance t In the case of the availability of multiple power
levels we change the reward function as given in Equationrt  a  P DRt  b  attrt  a  P DRt  b  att  c  P W RtwhereP W R P owerM ax  P owerChosen

the following combinations of the constants a  1 b  03
a  1 b  05 and a  1 b  03 c  015 These
constants act as hyperparameters and can be chosen according
to the requirements of the application Hence in the reward
function we have proposed to actively penalize the learning
agent until it is able to achieve a good PDR while keeping the
power consumption as low as possibleC Proposed AlgorithmAlgorithm 1 shows the workow of the proposed algorithmMajor benets of our proposed algorithm are1 Adaptive Behaviour The ability of DDQN to contin

of 100 uniformly distributed mobile LoRa EDs with both the
capture effect and the intersf collisions enabled The mobility
speed was set to 5050 mh A sharp drop in the PDR of
LoRaMAB can be seen which shows its inability to learn in
an environment comprising of mobile LoRa EDs4 minutes The simulation time is set to 50 times of the mean
rate The bandwidth is xed at 125 kHz for all EDs Currently
we have considered a single channel The specications of the
neural network are given in TableA Learning of the Proposed AlgorithmThe PDR of our algorithm while learning is shown in Fig1 The gure shows that our agent can converge its learning in
200 khours however LoRaMAB is not able to learn a better
PDR in case of an environment consisting of mobile LoRa EDsEDs in the experimental setup are mobile and they follow the
GaussMarkov mobility model An improvement of more than
500 can be seen in the PDR over LoRaMAB As the learning
is independent of the EDs so we propose the training of the
model to be done in a simulation The trained model can then be
netuned in a real environment Due to the adaptive behavior
of DRL compared to LoRaSim and LoRaMAB our model wibe less susceptible to adversarial attacks which in the case of
LoRa can be frequency jamming etcB Experiment 1 Performance evaluation using uniformly dis
tributed EDsFig 2a shows the performance of our algorithm in a eld
consisting of LoRa EDs distributed uniformly We have tested
with the capture effect CE and interSF collisions The effect
of these cannot be clearly seen in the provided graphs but
will be noticeable in dense IoT networks It can be seen that
our model can achieve a PDR greater than 09 in a network
containing 100 EDs in a single channel environment Fig 2ashows the average power usage per packet sent It shows that
our agent can achieve an average power usage of 0185 Joule
per packet with 100 EDs in the network which is an optimapower choice The EDs have only a single power level to choose
from ie 14 dbIn our experiments we consider an environment of 100 LoRa
EDs spread in a radius of 4500 meters with a single basestation
at the center We use a data frame size of 50 bytes Typical IoT
use cases generate small data packets hence 50byte frame size
can represent a large number of IoT use cases The data is being
generated using a poison distribution with a mean rate  ofC Experiment 2 Performance evaluation based on varying
percentages of intelligent EDsWe compare the effect on overall performance in a network
containing different percentages of intelligent EDs We consider
an ED whose decision is made by the DRL agent as an intelli

a random parameter combination out of the available parameter
combinations We dont limit the parameter combination of any
ED All the available combinations are available to the ED to
choose from EDs have only a single power level to choose
from ie 14 db It can be seen that the performance deteriorates
in case of a reduction in the count of intelligent devices When
EDs choose a random parameter combination the packets either
suffer collisions or they are lost On the other hand if an ED is
intelligent the parameters are chosen by the gateway based on
the environment hence fewer collisions The obtained results
have been shown in Fig 2bD Experiment 3 Performance evaluation using multiple avail
able power levelsIn this experiment we add multiple power levels as a choice
8 11 14 dbs for a power level to be used In this case the
reward function given in Equation 2 is used The results are
shown in Fig 2c It can be seen that our agent can achieve
an optimal per packet power usage of 014 Joule which is much
less than the average per packet power usage in the scenario of
a single choice of power level ie 018 Joule Hence our agent
can save power while ensuring the same PDR performance as
in the case of one power leveV CONCLUSIONSWe have provided and tested the rst deep reinforcement
learning DRLbased approach for adaptive PHY layer pa
rameters selection in dense LoRa networks that ensures fewer
collisions and better performance than the existing stateofthe
art PHY layer parameter assignment algorithms We show that
our algorithm is not only adaptive and computationally efcient
but is also able to support mobile end devices
Urban air quality is increasingly becoming a cause for concern for the health of the human population The poor air quality is
already wreaking havoc in major cities of the world where serious health issues and reduction of average human life by a factor of years
are reported The air quality in developing countries can become worse as they undergo development The urban air quality varies
nonlinearly depending upon the various factors such as land use industrialization waste disposal trafc volume etc To address this
problem it is necessary to look at the plethora of available literature from multiple perspectives such as types and sources of pollutants
meteorology urban mobility urban planning and development health care economics etc In this paper we provide a comprehensive
survey of the stateoftheart in urban air quality We rst review the fundamental background on air quality and present the emerging
landscape of urban air quality We then explore the available literature from multiple urban air quality measurement projects and provides
the insights uncovered in them We then take a look at the sources that are signicantly contributing to polluting the air quality Finally we
highlight open issues and research challenges in dealing with urban air pollutioncid1 INTRODUCTIONAir pollution is dened as the release of pollutants in the
air that has detrimental consequences on human health
and the planet as a whole These pollutants can be from
manmade sources or natural sources  Natural sources
of air pollution include res sand storms volcanic activity
fumaroles and others The manmade air pollutants are
gases droplets particulate matter and radiation are emitted
into the atmosphere due to human activity such as burning
wood coal gas oil alcoholbased fuels diesel kerosene
biomass waste etc It also includes power plants and
chemical factories that emitted toxic gases particulate matter
and radiation in the environment These air pollutants
are causing issues such as acid rains urban smog ozone
depletionholes indoor air pollution and global warming
 Air pollution is a complex amalgamation of natural and
human activities The impact of this relationship is evident
in metropolitan areas Beijing Dehli etc where criteria
pollutants meteorology infrastructure and various emission
entities collectively deteriorate the air quality It is iteratively
reported in the literature that 70 to 80 of the pollution
in the developing world is due to automobile emissions
where vehicles using lowgrade oil on poorly planned road
infrastructure are major contributors to the poor air quality
 Major cities in the world are suffering from rapid
degradation of the air quality that has pernicious outcomes
on the health of the citizens economy plantation crops and
livestock A decline in human life expectancy in metropolitan areas
is accredited to their poor air quality The problem will get
even worse with the urban development taking place in
underdeveloped countries  In 2013 World Health Organi
zation WHO categorized air pollution as a carcinogen for
human beings  WHO also estimated two million deaths
per year and numerous respiratory illnesses because of poor
urban air quality  The global rise in air pollution hasresulted in a sharp growth in various allergies and respiratory
diseases The impact of air pollution is not limited to the
metropolitan areas it also affects the environment on a globascale causing health concerns far away from its origin In
2015 air pollution alone caused 64 million death worldwide
and if the current trend continues by 2060 the deaths caused
by ambient air pollution will be nearly 9 million people
per year  In 2015 out of all cardiovascular deaths
19 were caused by air pollution similarly 23 deaths
due to lung cancer were because of air pollution and air
pollution was the reason for 21 of the total deaths caused
by strokes   Four million new asthma cases andmillion premature childbirths per year are attributed to fossifuelbased air pollutants that cause a dent in the GDP Furthermore air pollution appears to be a risk factor not
yet quantied in neurodevelopmental disorders in kids and
neurodegenerative illnesses in adults   Air pollution not only affects human health on a globascale but it also has an enormous economic cost The cost
for air pollution emitted by burning fossil fuels in 2018 is
approximately 29 trillion USD that is 33 of the globaglobal gross domestic product GDP  It is way less than
the money needed to reduce the effect of the air pollution
caused by burning fossil fuels The toll of air pollution on
the economy is estimated by looking at the six aspectscost of human life 2 peoples ability to work 3 effects
on the food 4 reduction in the ability of the ecosystem to
work 5 damages to the historical monuments and 6 cost
of remediation and restoration1 The economic burden of air
pollution on the GDP of China is 66 for India it is 54
for Russia it is 41 for Germany and US it ranges from
30 to 35 for Japan United Kingdom and France it ranges
from 20 to 25   It indicates that a monumentaeffort is needed to address the air pollution is the need of the
hour1   2022 by the authors Distributed under a Creative Commons CC BY licens air quality is considered a signicant contributor to yield
reduction for many decades Air pollution is rapidly becom
ing a threat to food production and safety  Effects of air
pollution on human health have been covered rigorously in
the literature compared to agriculture The adverse effects
of air pollution on the crops vary with the concentration
of the pollutants geographical locations and meteorologyBurning wood and fossil fuel produce sulfur dioxide that
reduces the life and yield of the crops2 Rising levels of
acid deposition ammonia O3 and CO are also affecting the
crops in the developing world3 In 2014 India reports a 50
reduction in the wheat and rice crop yield due to ambient
air pollution   It also highlights the need for serious
reconsideration in environmental policies around the world
to ensure food securityThe global temperature has risen by 12C over pre
industrial levels The climatic catastrophe is upon us The
whole world has started feeling the repercussions like
wildres heat waves droughts etc Air pollution has played
a vital part in this climatic catastrophe United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals UNSDG 391 anddirectly aim at reducing the mortality rate due to ambient
air pollution and the adverse aspects of particulate air
pollution in urban areas by 2030 Achieving these UNSDG2   for reducing the adverse effects of air pollution in
underdeveloped and developing countries is perhaps a
challenging taskIdentifying the pollution sources contributions and
root causes spatiotemporal manner are the vital challenges
associated with urban air quality measurements Lastly
based on the spatiotemporal analysis of the urban air quality
making policy recommendations for reducing air pollution
is the motivation for this study In this paper we have tried
to answer the following question through a extensive review
of the existing literature1 What are the major air quality modelling and measurement techniques2 What are the major sources of air pollution and howto best classify them3 What is the situation of the air quality around the
globe and what are the best practices followed for
mitigating the poor air quality4 How the major air quality measurement and im
provement projects are measuring and dealing with
the urban air pollution and what challenges are
needed to be addressed in order to improve the
effectiveness of these projects5 What are the open research challenges in measuringthe urban air qualityContributions of the paperIn this paper we build upon the existing literature available
on the air quality measurement and provide a comprehensive Paper
paper are as follows We provide the fundamentals of air quality measure
ments along with a nonexhaustive summary of the
air pollutants and their potential sources We present a comprehensive survey of the techniques
for measuring the urban air quality along with severasensors famously used for measuring the pollutants We also discuss the previousongoing air quality
measurement projects from various entities and also
summarize a few root cause analyses from the liter
ature for determining the contributors in urban air
pollution We also highlight the challenges in designing an air

of the air pollutants it is vital to understand the composition
of pollutantfree dry air Dry air is essentially a combination
of Nitrogen 78 and Oxygen 21 The remaining 1
is a combination of Argon 09 and extremely minute
quantities of Carbon Dioxide Methane Hydrogen Helium
and others Water vapor is also a typical albeit very variable
component of the atmosphere ranging from 001 to 4 by

health effects21 Air PollutionAir pollutants are particles gases or droplets emitted in
the environment that exceeds the environments capacity of
absorption dilution and dissipation These pollutants are
gases solid particles liquid droplets etc The effect of these
pollutants at a scale is termed as air pollution5 Air pollution
is increasingly becoming a signicant contributor in causing
public health heart and lung disease respiratory diseases
etc and environmental issues global warming acid rains
reduction in crop yields depletion of the Ozone layer etcat a global scale211 Criteria PollutantsUS Environmental protection agency EPA divided air
pollutants into the following six categories that provide
sufcient enough information for determining the overall air
quality are known as criteria pollutants Carbon Monoxide CO Carbon Monoxide is a gas
emitted into the atmosphere due to the fossil fueburning in automotive vehicles It has no smell or
color It reduces the Oxygen supply to the body parts
thus hindering proper functioning It also causes
headaches dizziness heart and respiratory issues Nitrogen Oxides Nitrogen Oxide is a gas emitted
in the atmosphere due to the fossil fuel burning in
vehicles and power plants It has a smell and reddish
brown color It causes coughs shortness of breath and
respiratory infections It is also a major contributor
to acid rain that is very harmful to crops plants and
animals Sulfur Dioxide SO2 Sulfur Dioxide is a colorless
gas emitted into the air due to oil and coalburning
power plants and chemical factories It has a rotten
egglike smell It is a contributor to acid rain that is
harmful to crops plants and animals It is also very
harmful to people with respiratory diseases Ozone O3 Ozone is not directly emitted in the
atmosphere it is a byproduct of the reaction betweenNitrogen Oxide and organic compounds under the
sunlight Nitrogen Dioxide and organic compounds
emissions are due to a wide range of processes such
as coaloilburning power plants factories trees etcOzone here must not be confused with the Ozone
layer present in the stratosphere It is the main
contributor to smog that can lead to respiratory issues
such as Asthama It also causes ear nose and throat
ENT issues Ozone is also harmful to crops and
plants Particulate Matter Solidliquid droplets suspended
in the air called particulate matter These particles are
inhalable with a width less than 01 mm and a size as
small as 000005 mm PM10 and PM25 are prime
examples of these particles PM10 and PM25 are
inhalable particles with a size less than or equal tomicrometers and less than or equal to 25 micrometers
respectively These particulate pollutants cause lungs
and heart issues and are harmful to crops and plants Lead Pb Lead is a toxic metal with many variantsIt is emitted into the environment by automotive
vehicles burning substandard gasoline The chemicafactories and power plants are also contributors to
emitting this toxic metal into the atmosphere Lead
causes kidney issues strokes and heart failure 22 Sources of air pollutionSources of air pollution are generally divided into four
categories221 Natural sourcesNatural events are the initial sources of air pollution in
the world These events are also fundamental parts of the
ecosystem and also had an associated planetary cost Forest
res volcanic eruptions dust storms decomposing organic
matter biological processes in the soil lightning and sea
spray are a few examples of the natural events degrading
the air quality The natural events result in creating different5

AIoTtypes of criteria pollutants volatile organic compounds and
biological pollutants222 Mobile sourcesMobile sources of air pollution are considered very deadly for
human health Here trafc encompasses cars buses trucks
trains planes etc Mobile sources are also considered one of
the major sources of air pollution Air pollution is a result
of the vehicles used for commuting people and resources
 The vehicle exhaust suspended and resuspended road
dust brake dust and tire wear are sources of trafcrelated
emissions  Mobile emissions sources result in different
criteria pollutants and volatile organic compounds with
harmful effects on the ecosystem223 Stationary sourcesand so forth Stationary sources of air pollution are often
known as point sources The burning of fossil fuels metaprocessing processes boilers in industries and power plants
oil rening procedures solvents glues and paint thinners are
all producers of criterion pollutants such as volatile organic
compounds and hazardous pollutants mercury dioxin etc224 Area sourcesAir pollution sources such as agricultural areas replaces
construction processes in cities heating and cooling units
in the buildings are categorized as area sources of urban
air pollution The pollutants from area sources result in
particulate matter and other criteria pollutants Household
emissions also contribute to the degradation of air qualityProcesses like biomass combustion fossil fuel burning such
as coal diesel kerosene oil etc tobacco smoking and cen
tral air conditioning are a few important sources of household
emissions Household emissions create different criteria and
biological pollutants Since this paper only considers ambient
air pollution indoor air pollution sources are out of the scope
of this work We also want to note here that multiple sources
from diverse surroundings contribute to urban air pollution
which varies depending on the geographical location of
the pollution sources in the city wind direction and speed
humidity and other meteorological conditions and so onTherefore attributing urban air pollution to a single pollution
source is an inaccurate approach to look at this issue The
relationship between criteria pollutants and their sources
is provided in table 4 The table is made based on the
information provided by the US EPA7 and NPS23 Air quality indexThe air quality index AQI is a metric used for quantifying
and communicating the air quality in a particular locationAQI suggest the amount of air pollutant in the air over a
specic average interval These air pollution concentration
values are measured by a sensor or extrapolated from
a simulationemulation model The concentration of the
pollutant and time window is used to determine the dose of
the air pollution and insights from epidemiological research
provide its health impacts Based on these health impacts
a color code and a health advisory are issued for a specic
range of the AQI values The air quality information varies
for different countries based on their air quality standards
and thus their air quality indices AQI value for a given
pollutant is determined by the following piecewise linear
functionI IHigh  ILow
CHigh  CLowC  CLow  ILowwhere I is the air quality index C is the concentration of the
pollutant CLow is the concentration breakpoint that is less
than or equal to C CHigh is the concentration breakpoint that
is greater than or equal to C ILow is the index breakpoint
corresponding to CLow and IHigh is the index breakpoint
corresponding to CHighMeasurement data for AQI is averaged over one hour
there are few pollutants such as Ozone O3 P M25 and P MStationary air pollution sources include power plants in
dustrial facilities oil reneries industries sewage treatment7

health associated with it9 Different countries have their air
quality policies and thus have different cutoff values3 AIR QUALITY LANDSCAPEBefore proceeding with the discussions of air quality mod
eling and measurement it is imperative to examine the
current global air quality landscape by gleaning insights from
various studies on the impact of air pollution and mitigation
initiatives undertaken in various parts of the world The air
quality life index AQLI 31 Asia311 ChinaChina is the most populated country in the world It is home
to 1847 of the total population of the world 61 of its
population lives in cities In 2013 the concentration of the
PM25 in Beijing city was so high that it seemed that the
city will become uninhabitable  At the time an average
person in the Beijing city was exposed to approximatelygm3 of PM25 air pollution It is nine times higher than the
WHO recommended value for PM25 In January 2014 the
situation got even worse when the PM25 concentration went
35 to 40 times higher than the WHO recommended value
and the city ofcials warned people to stay indoors  The
Guardian describes it as Beijings airpocalypse Similarly
in Shanghai the air pollution went beyond the critical level
there the recorded PM25 concentration was six times more
than the WHO recommended valueGiven the situation in 2014 the Chines government
released a national air quality action plan worth 270 Billion9  docsFINALREPORT AQI pdf
10  with the sole purpose of bringing the air pollution
down The plan has three goals1 Reduce the PM10 by 10 relative to its value in2 Reduce the PM25 by 25 in BeijingTianjinHebei
by 20 in the Pearl river delta and by 15 in the
Yangtze river delta3 Reduce annual PM25 of Beijing to 60 gmThe national air quality action plan worked for China
by 2017 the PM25 concentration in BeijingTianjinHebei
went down by 36 In Pearl and Yangtze delta the air
pollution went down by 27 and 34 respectively This
success was achieved due to a collaborative effort from
different government entities in reducing the dependency
on coal controlling car emissions increasing renewable
energy enforcing emission policies reducing steel and plastic
manufacturing and replacing coal boilers with natural gas
or electric heaters  Though these steps have improved
the air quality in China the war against air pollution is not
over as longterm solutions for bringing air pollution down
to the WHOs recommended values are needed312 IndiaIndia is the 2nd most populated country in the world with
1770 of the population of the world 35 of the total Indian
population lives in cities India is also the 2nd most polluted
country in the world In 2019 the average PM25 value
was 703 gm3 that is seven times higher than the WHO
recommended value 10 microgramscubic meter Delhi
Uttar Pradesh and northern India are the most polluted
areas where air pollution is reducing almost a decade of
life expectancy of the residents   AQLI India fact
sheet In 2019 India declared war against pollution and an
nounced a veyear national clean air program NCAP with
42 million USD for the rst two years  The goal of NCAP
is to bring the air pollution down by 20 to 30 in 102 cities
which are over the national ambient air quality standard
NAAQS by building institutional capacity in monitoring
and mitigating the air pollution  The potential impact of
NCAP in the coming years is a 25 improvement in the air
quality and an improvement of 2 to 3 years in the total life
expectancy of the general public 313 IndonesiaIndonesia is the 4th most populated country in the world
with a 56 urban population More than 93 of its popula
tion is exposed to air pollution that is poorer than the WHOs
air quality standards Indonesia is also facing wildre issuesIn 2015 nearly 100000 wildres were recorded The average
PM25 concentration in Indonesia is 40gm3  Jakarta
is the most congested and one the most polluted city in the
world 315 of the PM25 and 70 of PM10 particles in
Jakarta air pollution are emitted by the automotive vehiclesTen coal power plants around the city are also adding to the
particulate pollution by emitting black carbon  Inthe air quality in Sumatra and Kalimantan was below the
WHO recommended threshold In the last 20 years the air
quality in these cities has gone three times poorer than the
recommended value This shift is because of illegal peatland
agriculture deforestation and wildres The Indonesian government has taken initial steps in
overcoming the air quality issue by adopting the Eurofuel enforcing automotive health monitoring policies and
developing a peatland restoration agency Indonesias coal
based energy production has doubled in the last ten years
and this is due to the tradeoff between the economy and
pollution A lot of collaborative effort is needed to ensure the
better air quality in Indonesia314 PakistanPakistan is the fth most populated country with one of
the highest population growth rates 20 On the AQpollution ranking it is ranked 4th in the most polluted
countries Pakistan has seen a 20 increase in the PMconcentration in the last two decades  Lahore has the
poorest air quality in Pakistan where PM25 concentration is
six times higher 64gm3 than the WHOs recommended
value  If this level of pollution concentration is sustained
an average person in Lahore will lose approximatelyyears of life expectancy Almost 99 of the total population
is exposed to pollution levels higher than the recommended
WHO air pollution values Citing this looming threat the Pakistani government
started enforcing the air pollution regulations for improving
urban air quality In 2017 following three initiatives are taken
to ensure improvement of the air qualityStubble burning is a major contributor to air pollu
tion in Pakistan The government of Punjab banned
stubble burning and promoted alternative methods
for getting rid of stubble Emission regulations were enforced on the vehiclesfactories and brick kilnsFor improving the air quality Pakistan has also
shut down many coalbased power plants for two
months This measure has improved the air quality
but resulted in many power outagesPakistan can improve air quality sustainably by exploiting re
newable power sources and continuously enforcing emission
regulationspolluted country in the world   The air pollution
there is so intense that an average person loses approximately
67 years of life expectancy Nearly 100 of the Bangladesh
population is exposed to air pollution nearly seven times
more than the WHO recommended air pollution concentra
tion 10gm3 for PM25 Major sources of air pollution in
Bangladesh are brick kilns vehicle emissions cement facto
ries unplanned constructions and steel rerolling  In
metropolitans like Dhaka the concentration of the particulate
pollutants PM25 and PM10 stayed manifold higher than
the recommended air pollution concentration values The
concentration of other air pollutants like inorganic gases is
noted to stay below the recommended valuesGiven the dangerous situation of the ambient air quality
in major cities the Bangladesh government has started imple
menting various countermeasures to control and mitigates
air pollution Bangladesh developed 11 xed continuous air
quality measurement stations in 8 major cities The stations
are capable of measuring the concentration of various types
of air pollutants The recorded data from these monitoring
stations helps develop a spatiotemporal map of different air
pollutants that translates into the identication of the air
pollution trends in the country Data gathered through these
monitoring stations is also used for developing air models
and AQI for public informationOn the policy front many initiatives are taken to enforce
the emission policies on brick cement and related industries
by banning the import of coal with high sulfur contentBangladeshs government is also incentivizing the industry
to move towards renewable and energyefcient production
procedures Initiatives like Clean Air and Sustainable En
vironment Project CASE and Grater Dhaka Sustainable
Transport are also working with the brick cement and
transport industries to reduce emissions Strict enforcement
and monitoring are necessary to ensure the improvement in
the ambient air quality and the Department of Environment
in Bangladesh has started doing that316 NepaNepal is suffering from a grim air pollution problem Almost
all of its population is living in an air pollution concentration
higher than the WHO recommended values According to
the AQLI Nepal fact sheet 2019 Nepal is ranked as the third
most polluted country in the world with an average PMconcentration of 612gm3 that is ve times higher than the
acceptable concentration value The average person in Nepais expected to lose at least ve years worth of life expectancy
if the current levels of air pollution persist The brick kiln
fuel burning vehicle emissions and road dust are primary
contributors to Nepals air pollution Nepal is far behind in
combating the air quality issues that are affecting the health
of its citizens More details on the air quality about Asian
countries such as South Korea  Thailand  etc are
available on 32 Europe315 BangladeshBangladesh is the 8th most populated country in the world
with a 39 urban population Bangladesh is also the mostCompared to Asia Europe already has better air quality The
majority of Europes concentration of particulate pollutants
is below the European Unions air pollution limits 25gmbut over threequarters of Europes population lives in regions that do not satisfy the World Health Organizations
WHO stricter recommendation of 10gm3  The entire
population of Poland Belarus Slovakia the Czech Republic
Slovenia Hungary Lithuania Armenia Belgium Germany
Moldova Cyprus and Ukraine and the Netherlands and
San Marino are exposed to pollution levels that do not satisfy
WHO guidelines  Warsaw Po Valley and Milan are
three severely polluted areas in Europe If particle pollution

year and two months  Bursa Turkeys industrial centersuffers from severe particle pollution as well The population
of Bursa will gain one year and one month if the level of
pollutants are reduced to meet WHO guidelines Largescale
biomass burning and unfavorable weather conditions are
causing air quality issues in the Northern Fennoscandia
region Norway Sweden Finland and Russia  In the
last two decades Northern Europe has seen a rise in air
pollution due to several largescale biomass burning episodes
in Eastern Europe causing serious consequences for human
health and local ecosystemsAccording to the European Environmental Agency EEAair quality report 2020 15 of the European population

PM25 is around 20gm3 that is twice the WHO recom
mended values for the PM25 With current levels of air
pollution an average person tends to lose approximatelyyears of life expectancy Benin Congo Republic of the Congo
and the Democratic Republic of the Congo Ghana Nigeria
and Togo are among the top air polluted countries in the
region These countries are also ranked among the countries
having the worst air quality in the world According to the
AQLI air pollution ranking Nigeria is ranked 6th in the most
polluted country In few Nigerian cities Onitsha Lagos etc
an average person is expected to lose four to six years of
life expectancy Brazzaville in the Republic of Congo has
the worst concentration of PM25 415gm3 and resulting
in 23 years of reduction in the total life expectancy of an
average person The Volta region in Ghana is also suffering
from a poor air quality situation where the air pollution
concentration is four times the WHO AQG values The air
quality meeting the WHO AQG values will add three years
to the life expectancy of an average person in Ghana Burning
fossil fuels is the primary reason for air pollution in Centraand West Africa Coal consumption is expected to increase
exponentially in the coming yearsThe African countries have to strike a balance between
economic growth and air pollution Air quality data gath
ering and environment preservation policies are still not
designed Only Cameron has introduced the National Air
Quality standard for particulate pollution The African coun
tries need a coordinated effort to control the emissions and
implementation of air quality standards and environmentapreservation policies
MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUESIn this section we discuss air quality monitoring modeling
and measurement techniques We divide this section into
four major components along with a necessary discussion
and lesson learned subsection The four major components
are air quality monitoring networks air quality modeling
techniques air quality measurement techniques and air
quality data41 Air quality monitoring networkAn air quality monitoring network is used to acquire con
sistent objective and standardized information regarding a
regions air quality This information may include concentra
tions of target pollutants It also allows for necessary steps to
be taken in any environmental protection and public health
safety effort These steps include determination and controof emission sources and keeping the public informed about
the state of the air quality  Madruga et al By far efforts in establishing air quality monitoringnetworks are broadly categorized in the following groups411 Fixed station air quality monitoringFixed air quality monitoring stations are the most reliable
standardized accurate and highly expensive method Fixed
air quality stations require highly trained staff and resources
to manage the measurement and maintenance operationSometimes these costs even exceed the purchase cost of the
station Thus most of the xed air quality monitoring stations
around the globe are installed and operated by government
agencies In US 4000 air quality stations are installed by stateenvironmental agencies13 The EEA receives data from 3000
2500 and 1000 stations for measuring NO2 PM10 and PMrespectivelyVarious efforts have been made to create an ideal air
quality monitoring network that can offer comprehensive air
quality measurements Elkamel et al 412 Mobile air quality monitoringGiven the price and the nature of the xed air quality
monitoring stations there has been a lot of attention to
the development of mobile air quality monitoring stationsMobile air quality monitoring stations offer a costeffective
solution with several promising features such as high

stations are summarized in Table413 Satellite based air quality monitoringThe use of satellitebased sensors for the determination of
air quality has been gaining momentum for a long time nowLi et al 414 Integrating satellite data with ground stationsSullivan et al 42 Air quality modelling techniquesThe environment is a complex reactive system where multi
ple physical and chemical processes are happening contin
uously The air quality measurement at a specic locationand time provides a conditional spatiotemporal snapshot of
the environment The interpretation of spatiotemporal air
quality information requires a conceptual understanding
of atmospheric dynamics that is not possible without a
sophisticated air quality model Measurement alone is also
not enough for policymakers to devise an effective plan
to address the looming challenge of air quality The air
quality models provide necessary mathematical information
for understanding the complex interactions between different
variables affecting air quality Therefore a combination of air
quality measurement and air quality models can yield reaprogress in understanding and solving the air quality issues
in urban centersA comprehensive air quality model is supposed to
take into consideration the meteorology chemical trans
formations emission patterns known source information
point of interest POI and removal processes and provide
spatiotemporal emission uxes and pollutant concentrationsIt also highlights the relation between the rate of change
in pollution concentrations and the potential sources Figure 2 illustrates the bare minimum inputs and output
of an air quality model The three most commonly used
air quality modeling approaches are dispersion photochem
ical and receptor modeling We briey describe all three
modeling techniques along with their different variantsAir quality is not a local phenomenon Understanding the
contribution of different variables in the air quality landscape
is a challenging task Modeling these contributions is not
possible through classical air quality modeling techniquesFor completeness we have included the famous classicaair quality modeling techniques Though these techniques
are not suitable to model the complex relationships between
different contributing variables in the air quality at a scale
many advanced modeling techniques are designed based on
the insights from these classical techniques Box models The box model is the simplest modefor estimating the concentrations of air pollutantsThe box model compares a domains airshed to a
rectangular box within which the pollutants mass
is entirely contained  It is used for labscale air
quality experiments It is also suitable for modeling
indoor air quality More information on the box modeis available on   Gaussian models Gaussian models are the most
popular air quality models used in the literature to NoPaper   MixedCycle bike

cases These models are frequently used in regulatory
applications The Gaussian model assumes that the
plume spread is a result of molecular diffusion Pollu
tant concentrations in the plume spread horizontally
and vertically  The solution to the diffusion
equation with varying initial value and boundary
conditions results in a Gaussian distribution of the
pollutant concentrations  For further details on
the Gaussian air quality models we refer the reader
to   Eulerian models The Eulerian air quality modeling
approach is considered one of the most signicant
modeling techniques It is often known as the grid
model technique In this technique the area under
consideration is divided into equal size small gridcells and conservation of the mass equation is solved
for a specic type of pollutants concentrations A set of mathematical equations in a given coordinate
system explain the transport diffusion transforma
tion and deposition of pollutant emissions in each ce This modeling approach is used for studying
and simulating longrange transport air quality over
the entire airshed Further details on the Eulerian air
quality modeling we refer the reader to  
 Lagrangian models The Lagrangian models calculate
the wind trajectories and the transportation of the
plume along these trajectories For sourceoriented
models these trajectories are calculated forward in
time and for receptorbased models these trajectories
are calculated back in time  Lagrangian modeling is frequently used to span a longer time duration
up to years These models are also used to model the
concentrations of the particulate matter in the air For
more information on the Lagrangian models we refer
the reader to  421 Dispersion modellingAir dispersion models formulate and simulate the dispersion
of the pollutants emitted by different sources The simulation
provides an estimation of the downward air pollutant
concentration Dispersion models are used to predict the
concentration for specic scenarios such as the change of the
pollution source These models are more suited for pollutants
that react in the environment and spread over large distancesThe models are also widely used by regulatory bodies during
the preparation and evaluation of air permit applicationsPublic safety and emergency response personals utilize these
models to determine toxicity in the air due to possible gas
release events Environmental protection agencies around the
globe measure the effect of emissions from different sources
and pollution control strategies by using the dispersion
models1 AERMOD modeling system The American Meteo
rological Society AMSUS EPA Regulatory ModeImprovement Committee AERMIC a joint working
group of scientists from the AMS and the EPA
created the AERMOD dispersion modeling system It
is a steadystate Gaussian plume model that includes
air dispersion based on planetary boundary layer
turbulence structure and scaling ideas as well as
handling of complex terrain simple and intricate
topography It generates pollutant concentrations
in the ambient air on a daily monthly and yearly
basis It is an updated version of the IndustriaSource Complex ISCST3 framework proposed by
the USEPA for analysing the inuence of industriasources on air quality in the coming years 
 AERMOD consists of a dispersion modefor shortrange dispersion of air pollutants from
various sources a meteorological data preprocessor
AERMET and a terrain preprocessor AERMAP  The AERMOD dispersion model takes
preprocessed meteorological parameters and pre
processed relation between complex terrain features
and air pollution plumes to produce an air quality
model   Further details on various ver
sions of its source codes implementation details
and variable details are available at 2 CTDMPLUS Perry et adistortions in the plume near predened three
dimensional 3D terrain features while remaining
simple by applying owdistortion adjustments to
atterrain Gaussian and biGaussian pollution
distributions   The CTDMPLUS requires a
signicant amount of information on the topography
and weather to produce an efcient dispersion
model which often represents a bottleneck in many
circumstances More information on various versions
of the CTDMPLUS source code implementation
details and variable details are available at 
3 OCD Hanna et al Though US EEA recommends AERMOD CTDMPLUS and
OCD for air quality modeling they also provide an alter
native list of models that can be used by the regulatory
applications on a casebycase justication422 Photochemical modellingPhotochemical air quality models are often used to evaluate
the effectiveness of the control strategies for regulatory anal
ysis and attainment demonstrations Photochemical models
can model the air quality at different spatial scales local
regional national global etc Photochemical air quality
models are also known as photochemical grid models These
models are used to evaluate the changes in the concentrations
of the criteria pollutants due to the changes in the associated
variables meteorological conditions emission sources etcSimilarly these models are also used for accessing the
sensitivity of the pollutant predictions in different use casesPhotochemical grid models are also used to evaluate the
performance of pollution control policies They simulate the
concentration of the air pollutants at a large scale by using
a complex set of mathematical equations to characterize
different atmospheric processes physical and chemical Two
types of commonly used photochemical air quality models
are the Lagrangian trajectory model and the Eulerian grid
model The Lagrangian trajectory model uses the moving
frame of reference for modeling the air quality whereas the
Eulerian grid model applies xed 3D geometric models to the
ground to model the air quality of a particular geographicaarea1 Community Multiscale Air Quality CMAQCMAQ modeling system is a stateoftheart pho
tochemical air quality modeling system It uses
3D Eulerian modeling system to simulate the ef
fect of the criteria pollutants in urbantoregional tohemispheric scale CMAQ15 is developed and
distributed by US EPA as an opensource suite of
air quality modeling programs that can simulate
multiple air pollution use cases and predicts the con
centrations based on the historical data of the criteria
pollutants CMAQ is used to simulate and estimate
the performance of EPA missions for understanding
and forecasting air pollution human exposure to air
pollution watershed acidication  deposition
of nitrogen and sulfur  and many other air
pollutionrelated use cases Three common types of
CMAQ are WRFCMAQ Wong et al  CMAQDDM CMAQ decoupled direct
method CMAQDDM offers concentrations
and deposition sensitivity statistics for user
specied parameters  The motivation for
CMAQDDM comes from the desire to mea
sure the concentrations of the pollutants by
changing one or a few parameters out of many
predened air quality model parameters Air quality models usually take emissions as
input and predict their concentrations CMAQ
DDM provides the ability to the policymakers
to look at the pollution landscape by tweaking
the parameters of interest or emission sources
eg wildres vehicles etc More details on
the CMAQDDM are available in   CMAQISAM CMAQ Integrated Source Ap
portionment Method CMAQISAM is a vari
ant of CMAQ that measures the attribution of
the source in the overall value of the pollutant
concentrations predictedoutputted by the air
quality models For example identifying the
proportion of the smog created by the stubble
burning in a neighboring city This can be
achieved by running the CMAQ twice rst
with all emission use cases and second by
removing the source of interest but this wibe complex and computationally expensiveCMAQISAM this issue by calculating source
attribution of many sources directly by the

CAMx CAMx16 is another famous air quality
model in photochemical modeling CAMx modeling
system models the air quality with all criteria pollu
tants for a large scale city state country continent
level It takes emissions meteorology data land use
surface topography initial and boundary conditions
and chemistryrelated values as input and performs
source attribution sensitivity and process analysesEstes et al 4 Urban Airshed Model Variable Grid UAMV In
the early 1970s the most commonly used air mod
eling system was UAMV Photochemical Modeling
System18 UAMV was widely used for air quality
studies focused on Ozone It is a 3D photochemicagrid model that can model the effects of the chemicaand physical processes in the environment on the
concentrations of air pollutants UAMV also pro
vided a spatiotemporal distribution of the emissions
of various air pollutants UAMV is outdated and no
longer used for air quality modeling423 Receptor modellingThe third category of the air quality models is called receptor
models These models are mathematical techniques for
recognizing and quantifying the origins of air pollution at
a particular receptor location  Receptor models are
different from dispersion and photochemical air quality
models They do not require meteorological chemical and
emission data to estimate the participation of the pollution
sources in the air pollution concentrations at the receptorThe receptor model uses the chemical and inert properties
of gases SO2 CO etc and the particulate matter particles
to determine to contributions of the emission sources in the
pollution concentrations at the receptor  1 Chemical Mass Balance CMB The CMB 16 

18  about the pollution sources to determine the source
contributions CMB quanties the contributions at
the receptor based on the distinct source types rather
than individual emission sources A drawback of
CMB is its inability to distinguish between emis
sion sources with the same chemical and physicaproperties More details on the CMB are available in
2 Unmix Unmix19 model uses a formulabased on a
form of factor analysis to determine the chemicaspecies in the air and their sources It does not take
the chemical prole of the pollution sources as input
instead it generates the chemical prole to estimate
the number of pollution sources their syntheses and
their participation in the air pollution at the receptor
location3 Positive Matrix Factorization PMF PMF 43 Air quality measuring sensorsThe air quality sensors are the most crucial component of any
air quality monitoring network These sensors are used to
determine the concentration of pollutants in the air Typically
these sensors are built with a Lego connection for the data
acquisition card and data telemetry is accomplished using
WiFi or cellular communication In practice data processing
is done on the cloud rather than on the sensor however there
have been a few situations where data is preprocessed on
the air quality sensors Specications of air quality sensors
are broadly given by the following parameters1 Accuracy This is a measure of how close the read
ings of sensors would be as compared to the actuapollutant value2 Precision This is a measure of how well the sensor
reproduces the same reading A sensor with low
precision can give different readings at different
times with the same pollutant leve3 Range and detection limitations This is the mea
sure of range of pollutant concentration that the
sensor is able to detect correctly Sensor performance
may vary with different concentration of pollutant4 Copollutant interference Cross interference from
other pollutants also affect sensor readings It is
intended to minimize the copollutant interference
when measuring a certain pollutant5 Environmental interference Sensor performance
may vary under different environmental conditions
such as low and high temperature humidity sun
light etc6 Noise Noise is the source of inaccuracy in sensor
readings The effect of noise should be minimized to
produce more precise and accurate sensor readings7 Signal drift This is the drift in readings which
occurs due to inherent sensor measurement methods
and degradation of sensors components Many
air quality sensors suffer from signal drift When
selecting a sensor it should be ensured that the
drift can either be handled or it does not affect the
readings to a signicant leve8 Response time Different sensors can produce read
ings with different minimum time intervals It should
be ensured that the selected sensor is able to produce
readings with acceptable time intervals9 Multisite measurement performance This is an in
dicator that generalizes the copollutant interference
and the environmental interference of sensor431 Measurement TechniquesA summary of the types of sensors and measurement
techniques has been show in gure Particulate Matter Measurement of particulate mat
ter concentration is broadly categorized in three
methods gravimetric microbalance and optical mea
surements Whalley et al  Gravimetric method
is widely used by regulatory and certication au
thorities It is based on weight difference of a lter
medium before and after the gas is passed through
the lter Microbalance method uses the change
in resonant frequency to measure the particulate
matter concentration By far the most popular choice
for measurement commercial realtime particulate
matter sensors is the optical method Scattering or
absorption of a light beam is measured to determine
the concentration of particulate matter Gases The two major sensor types used for sensing
gaseous pollutants are electrochemical sensor 432 Sensing Solutions OEM Sensors OEM sensors comprise of just the
sensing element Further interfacing and signal con
ditioning is required to convert the sensor output
to meaningful numbers These sensors are popular
choice for original equipment manufacturers Sensing Systems Sensing systems are built upon the
OEM sensors and the output is provided in digitaformat Sensing systems are available for both indoor
and outdoor air quality monitoring Apart from
digital output many sensors are also available with
extra features such as WiFi or cellular connectivity
and mobile application to view the sensor outputs
as well as the resulting air quality index For many

free from regulatory requirements These systems
are widely available in market and their price is
usually below 5000 The data available through such
sensors is not accurate and it can sometimes produce
unknown errors Weather conditions can also affect
such sensing systemsTo mitigate all of the above problems and to provide
a standard measurement system the government
denes a certain set of regulations to conform to
for the measurement of air quality and pollutantsDetailed specications of measurement and reporting
of the concentration of pollutants is often provided
by the countrys environmental protection agency In
US Environmental Protection Agency EPA provides
Federal Reference Methods FRM and Federal Equiv
alence Methods FEM for measurement of pollutantsFRMs specify the most scientically sound technique
to report the concentration of pollutant and it becomes
the basis of criteria for evaluation of other measure
ment methods FEM provides techniques that are cost
effective and easier to implement and yet can provide
comparable level of accuracy with the FEMs Such
systems are very expensive and their price can range
up to 40000 They also highly trained technical staff
for its operation and maintenance Annual operating
expenses may also exceed the system cost On the
other hand the data provided through these systems
is highly consistent and accurate in a variety of
weather and environmental conditions 5 AIR QUALITY MEASUREMENT PROJECTS

NANA which intends to use big data eg trafc ow human
mobility and geographical data to solve key urban issues
such as pollution transportation congestion and energy
consumption The primary goal of Urban Air was to measure
analyze forecast and assist in the improvement of urban air
quality in cities such as Beijing China In addition Urban Air
sought to discover relationships between various air quality
trends to determine the sources of pollution in different
urban locationsThe Urban Air project consists of four stepsInferring negrained air quality

quality in areas where air quality stations were not available
 It is a difcult undertaking since accessible Air Quality
data is sparse and limited To tackle this challenge Zheng
et al 512 Forecasting air quality at each stationFollowing the successful inference of AQI values at arbitrary
sites the next phase in the Urban Air project was to forecast
AQI values at specic station locations  Forecasting AQvalues is critical because it allows policymakers to better un
derstand air pollution trends and develop preventative and
mitigation policies The method of estimating the next AQvalue at a certain time granularity based on prior AQI values
is known as AQI forecasting Various connected aspects
such as meteorology wind speeds temperature and so on
might have an impact on the forecasting process Therefore
a realtime database is utilized to give meteorological datahumidity temperature and wind speed as well as weather
forecasts and AQI values for each station siteThe forecasting component of the Urban Air project
gathers data from 2296 stations in 302 Chinese cities with
each instance having concentrations of six air pollutantsN O2 SO2 O3 CO P M25 and P M10 Zheng et al  A temporal predictor is used to anticipate the AQvalue using a linear regression model on the data A spatial predictor is used to provide the surrounding
context to a neural network which forecasts an AQvalue based on the context data A prediction aggregator trains a regression tree to
give various weights to the rst two predictions under
different scenariosFinally an inection predictor is employed to simulate
any rapid changes in AQI values and is only utilized
in exceptional cases rain etcFor the rst 16 hours the AQI value after each hour is
predicted while for the next 712h 1324h and 2548h
a minmax range of AQI is forecasted Zheng et al 513 Deployment of air quality monitoring stationsThe placement of air quality sensors in suitable places is
critical for obtaining relevant air quality data Hsieh et a514 Identication of root cause of air pollutionThe placement of air quality stations is motivated by the
need to identify the root causes of air pollution Urban Air
also seeks to identify the underlying causes of urban air pollution Understanding the root cause of air pollution is
extremely benecial to policymakers in government and
environmental protection agencies Because data collection
involves noise collecting insights for establishing the root
cause of air pollution becomes a difcult job Zhang et aThe Bayesian learning module of the root cause identi
cation pipeline combines the concentration measurements of
each pollutant at the target node with the spatial data from
candidate causers at the multiple time stamps Following
data integration initial routes for the N most signicant
sensor for the target locationstation are created Each of
these paths is then assigned a Grangercausality GC score
  Once the score is assigned to the pathways
the context data is integrated with pathways Zhang et aThe Urban Air project was a great success as it helped in
reducing air pollution in China Based on the insights from
this project the environmental protection agencies and the
Chines government have taken policylevel steps and the
air pollution in China is under contro52 AQLI projectThe Air Quality Life Index AQLI is another famous air
quality measurement project by the Energy Policy Institute
at the University of Chicago EPIC AQLI project introduced
a new metric for measuring the impact of air quality called
air quality life expectancy Instead of the conventional AQmetric this new metric translates the impact of air pollution
on the life expectancy of a human beingThe AQLI work is based on the PM25 data collected via
satellite monitoring combined with the global population
data obtained from the 2018 Global LandScan Global Popu
lation Database  The AQLI index is an extension of the
previous work done by Greenstone et al in understanding
and quantifying the impact of particulate air pollution on
the expectancy of human life  Once both datasets are
collected a gridcellbased procedure is used for combining
global population data with the satellitedriven PM25 dataLoss in life expectancy is calculated for each grid whereeach grid corresponds to a 6km x 6km area on the groundThe loss in life expectancy due to PM25 is computed based
on the previous work by Ebenstein et al The AQLI project has resulted in AQLI Index21 which
provides a countrylevel loss in life expectancy based on
the PM25 concentrations This project provides a thorough
analysis of the air pollution situation in many countries and
also covers the policy level steps taken by different countries
eg China India for mitigating the impact of air pollution
on the life expectancy of their citizens Though this project
only covers the impact of PM25 the insights and policy levesuggestions provided in the AQLI reports can help improve
the air quality of any part of the world This project is also
an excellent example of how to set up an air quality indexing
study for other criteria pollutants53 AfriqAirAir pollution is a major problem in Africa with research
indicating that air pollution causes around 800000 premature
deaths every year  Unfortunately there arent many
referencegrade air quality monitoring stations in Africa
therefore it is difcult to interpolate the actual situation of
the air pollution The AfriqAir project tries to tackle this
issue by developing a continentscale air quality monitoring
network AfriqAir is an African air quality monitoring
initiative  The initiative employs a network of both high
quality and lowcost air quality sensors By mid2020 there
are approximately 50 nodes spread throughout 11 African
nations Ghana Rwanda Uganda Kenya South Africa
Democratic republic of Congo Cote dIvoire Niger Congo
etc AfriqAir has the following three goals for improving
the air quality situation in Africa1 Creating the physical infrastructure required to mea
sure and monitor air quality across the continent It
entails a mix of highquality and lowcost air quality
assessment equipment as well as the necessary
power sources and data telemetry systems2 Local capacity building to use manage and analyzethe developed physical infrastructureFinally ensure that the physical infrastructures data
and insights are accessible and actionableThe data gathered through these 50 measurement platforms
across Africa is opensourced in daily hourly and 15minute
granularity and can be readily used for air quality research54 Ghana Urban Air Quality Project GHAirUrban Air and AQLI projects are being carried out on a
global scale using cuttingedge technology and techniques
for planning modeling monitoring and extracting insightsMany underdeveloped countries with limited resources do21 
22 not have this opportunity With the Ghana Urban Air Quality
Initiative GHAir we hope to show the reader how a
relatively impoverished nation may set up an air quality
monitoring projectGhana is West Africas secondmost populated country
behind Nigeria Ghana is dealing with severe pollution
problems and it is reported that air pollution killed over
28000 people in 2018  In 2019 Ghana started the GHAir
project to solve the problem through cuttingedge researchThe environmental protection agency of Ghana has limited
resources and proper technical human resources To solve
these issues GHAir uses lowcost air quality sensors to
bridge the data gap Various studies have highlighted that
lowcost sensors might be a great chance to overcome the
air pollution data gap in underdeveloped countries 
GHAir has the following four objectives that are also inline with the UNSDGs 1 Creating a dense lowcost air quality sensor network
in metropolitan areas to collect realtime spatiotem
poral air quality data that may be used to impact air
pollution management policy2 Launching public awareness campaigns about the
effects of urban air pollution and how residents may
safeguard their health in areas with poor air qualityImproving the air quality by introducing behaviorachanges in the communitiesPerforming epidemiological research to highlight the
health issues of air pollution exposure in vulnerable
populations for the public health departmentThe GHAir presently employs a mix of lowcost Pur
pleAir sensors Clarity nodes RAMPs and ModulairPM

Educating School ChildRen to tackle Air Pollution project
with the help of the Royal Society The projects goal is to
create awareness among schoolchildren about air quality and
how they may help to improve it The motto of the project is
School children as agents for improved air qualityThey are now experiencing several difculties in getting
data from sensors These concerns include the availability of
WiFi at deployment sites for data telemetry and sensor power
supply To address these issues GHAir is experimenting with
solar energy to power the sensors  Furthermore they
are attempting to leverage GPRS for data telemetry Despite
these challenges the GHAir project has enormous potentiafor bridging Ghanas data gap on air quality55 Hazewatch
PM25 concentrations above WHO standards have been
found in New South Wales Australia particularly in SydneyThe Department of Environment Climate Change and Water
DECCW has already placed 15 stations in various sites
across Sydney and data is published hourly AQI levels
and corresponding health advisories are provided based
on this pollution data Unfortunately these stations are
separated by tens of kilometers resulting in inadequate
spatial resolution Because of the low spatial resolution
complicated interpolation procedures are needed to report
AQI values As a result the DECCW AQI monitoring
network does not represent actual levels of air pollution and
exposure To overcome these shortcomings Sivaraman et a56 CITISENSEDeveloping a countrywide air quality network based on
referencegrade nearreference and lowcost air quality mon
itoring sensing solutions for each pollutant is a complicated
endeavor It requires a lot of money infrastructure and
technical expertise thus environmental governance through
citizen empowerment is gaining traction The purpose of
these programs is to encourage individuals in deploying low
cost sometimes nearreferencegrade monitoring equipment
and share air quality data The integration of data from
residents and referencegrade sensing equipment can assist in
obtaining a more granular picture of air quality resulting in
more effective air quality improvement measures The Euro
pean Commission has nanced CITISENSE23 20122016
a project that uses cuttingedge Earth observation technology
to build and test environmental monitoring systems The
projects goal was to create citizen observatories that would
allow residents to gather and monitor environmental data
in order to formulate community policies The CITISENSE
project produced a number of air quality sensor devices as
well as mobile and other communication technologies The
key contributions of the CITISENSE project wereStudying and mitigating hurdles in the citizens in
volvement in environmental decision making Designing the tools and technologies to enable the
citizens in collecting urban environmental data Providing lowcost measuring solutions and datafusion methods for scientic analysis23 Integrating newer sensing technologies IoT and other
ICT technologies cloud platforms data analysis and
learning techniques to enhance community participa
tion in the form of personal environmental monitoring
devicesThe CITI SENSE initiative distributed 324 air quality mon
itoring units around Europe and 400 volunteers helped
test the personal air quality monitoring devices A total of
24 citizen observatories were also developed in nine major
cities of Europe Barcelona Belgrade Edinburgh Haifa
Ljubljana Oslo Ostrava Vienna and VitoriaGasteiz An
air perception application was also a critical part of the
project and 1200 people used it to report and get air quality
information In 20152016 nearly 94 million environmentaobservations were collected using the CITISENSE sensor
network and other additional observation tools Further
involvement of the citizens was ensured by feedback surveys
questionnaires focus group discussions and interviews The
CITISENSE initiative resulted in environmental monitoring
systems across Europe as well as citizen engagement in
environmental governance The insights from the CITI

referencegrade air quality data is not enough as they are
very expensive and there can be a few referencegrade air

developing cuttingedge air quality measurement facilities
are only to understand the root cause of urban air pollution
and how it affects human health and the global tempera
ture Many studies have been conducted using air quality
data acquired from air quality networks to identify the
causescontributors of air pollution Karagulian et al Wang et al 6 URBAN AIR QUALITY CHALLENGESDespite a plethora of work in measuring and understanding
air quality there are various challenging aspects in tracking
and measuring air quality In this section we take a look at
the challenges needed to be addressed for rapid improve
ment in ambient and indoor air pollution61 Data collection and public datasetsCollecting the air quality data is a challenging task as it
involves different concentrations of air pollutants Given the
environmental cost and health risks of poor urban air quality
it is imperative to develop a central realtime air quality
data measurement and processing system Two paradigms
for gathering urban data ie air quality data POI mete
orological data etc are sensorcentric data collection and
crowdcentric data collection The sensorcentric paradigm                   doi1020944preprints2022040232vhas two categories These categories are based on whether
the data collecting sensors are mobile deployed on a moving
object or static deployed on a xed location The crowd
centric data collection is also divided into two categories
activedata generated via participatory surveys and check
ins or passive data generated by users passively while using
the urban infrastructureGathering air quality and related data via these twoparadigms is difcult because of the following challengesIn static sensorcentric air quality data collection
sensors are deployed at a xed location and they
communicate at a predened frequency to the cen
tral database ie cloud server This static sensor
deployment makes the air quality measurement a
resource constraint system limited budget land use
workforce for maintaining the system etc As a
result data gathered from very few sensors xed at
different locations in an urban environment is sparse
and not sufcient representative of the air quality
situation of the cityIn static sensorcentric air quality data collection
where the number of sensors is limited the optimaplacement of the air quality sensors for gathering
representative enough data becomes a challenge Though mobile sensorcentric data collection help
resolve the issues faced in air quality data gathering
due to the xed nature of the static sensorcentric
approach it has its challenges The air quality data
gathered from the sensors mounted on moving objects
such as buses bikes taxis UAVs etc is skewed by
the movement of these moving objects For example
buses are usually used as a means of the commute
from a busy xed route the gathered data wiprovide a good representation of the air quality along
the buss route but it will not provide a true depiction
of urban air quality Another challenge in mobile sensorcentric air quality
data is the redundancy in the collected data Since the
sensorsmounted vehicle will be following a route es
pecially buses the data collected will be redundant
and the data from less traversed routes will be sparseIt will result in an imbalanced data distribution Any
deduction made from the distribution will be biased
towards the most frequent route Human as a sensor is another way of getting the
data for inferring the air quality Data generated
by the citizens passively while accessing the urban
infrastructure call data record public Wi passenger
bus card swipes taxi pick and drop locations etc is
useful in determining the context of urban pollutionHere the key challenges are the privacy of the users
the security of the service providers and meeting the
legal requirements of data protection Participatory crowdsensing is a procedure opted for
gathering the context data used for inferring the urban
air quality where the measurement campaigns and
surveys are used to collect the data imbalance data
coverage unavailability of ground truth to measure
the quality of the collected air quality data and
noisy and fake data reporting are a few challengesassociated with the participatory crowdsensing for air
qualityrelated dataTo overcome these challenges in air quality data collection
along with its proper context requires a great deal of planning
and understanding of the urban environment Selecting the
right kind of sensors an acceptable level of measurement
granularity designing a proper measurement campaign
choosing the appropriate clouddatabase and ensuring the
quality of the collected air pollution data and the motivation
to make it public can help develop a comprehensive air
quality dataset for determining the correct air quality valuesNevertheless a hybrid approach combining sensorcentric
expertintheloop data collection techniques can yield better
air quality data collection62 Air quality monitoring networks in underdeveloped
countriesThe air quality situation in underdeveloped nations is dire
yet they are unable to address it due to a lack of air quality
monitoring networks Deploying these networks across the
country necessitates large sums of money and planning that
in many underdeveloped countries is not available Without
an adequate and extensive air quality monitoring network
in place economically developing nations are unable to
gather air quality data and as a result lack policies for
monitoring and combating air pollution trends Lowcost air
quality monitoring stations are used instead of actual weather
stations and deployed in a few countries Developing a
countrywide lowcost air quality sensorsbased network
remains a very challenging task63 Tradeoff between economic growth and air pollu
tionThe tradeoff between economic growth and air pollution im
plies that economic expansion is connected to industrializa
tion and transportation which necessitates the combustion of
gasoline and other energy sources resulting in air pollutionFinding the right balance between economic growth and
air pollution is a daunting task for many countries Other
variables such as population urban density and urban
planning exacerbate the difculty of this task64 Regularization and air quality measurementsEven though there are several environmental regulatory
bodies and a plethora of regulatory rules but we continue to
see that air quality in urban areas is becoming a predicamentThe implementation of these standards is an issue that
many governments are unable to address for a variety of
reasons including a lack of education nancial resources
political and religious divisions lack of global and regionacooperation and so on 65 Urban planning and air qualityUrban planning plays a vital role in improving the air
quality of the city Unfortunately many metropolitans around
the world are suffering from the worst air quality due to
exponential growth in population trafc congestions high
built densities and lack of urban planning Canyon street the street design in which both sides of the roadway are bordered
by buildings has a poor dispersion rate thus vehicle exhaust
remains in greater quantities than usual producing severe
health issues and air pollution Avoiding canyon street design
in urban planning might help to reduce urban air pollutionReducing urban air pollution from trafc is strongly linked to
initiatives for encouraging active commuting travel by low
energyconsuming vehicles and lowering carbon emissionsUrban planning and its relationship with different urban
environmental concerns is an area in which much ingenuity
is required7 CONCLUSIONS
The urban air quality is turning out to be daunting health and
economic challenge for the metropolitan centers around the
globe The lack of measuring infrastructure is making this
situation even harder This paper provides a nonexhaustive
yet comprehensive survey of the urban air quality measuring
methodologies standards and initiatives operating through
out the globe We have also emphasized the challenges
restricting the urban air quality measurement We also
invite the readers to ponder upon these challenges and offer
suggestions for better air quality in our cities66 Personalized contextaware air quality measure
ment applicationsDesigning contextaware air quality monitoring systems are
gaining traction Air quality is heavily reliant on severacontext factors PoIs meteorology etc and interpreting
air quality measurements without taking the context into
account might create bias in the measurements People
with respiratory or ocular diseases are especially sensitive
to air pollution and should be warned about it The AQmeasurements are insufcient for these patients It is very
challenging to develop contextaware custommade air qual
ity monitoring applications A few emerging applications use
the Internet of Things IoT and tailored context to deliver
customized warnings on the severity of air pollution in a
specic city location  67 Impact of climate change on the air qualityClimate change has started causing many problems in
different parts of the world Climate change can inuence the
local air quality and vice versa An increase in the ground
level O3 is observed as the atmosphere gets warmer due
to climate change and this groundlevel O3 is expected to
cause dense smogs in urban areas The jury is out on the
effectiveness of climate change on particulate matterbased
air pollution68 Indoor air pollutionAir quality within the buildings houses schools shopping
malls airports etc concerning the health of the people
health is termed as indoor air quality IAQ It is described
in the literature that the IAQ in homes is 2 to 5 times
more polluted than the ambient air pollution  CO
microbiological contamination owing to moisture insuf
cient ventilation fuel burning incorrect building design
and commonly used construction materials are a few of
the causes of increased indoor air pollution levels Long
term respiratory disorders cancer heart disease and short
term ENT irritations headaches tiredness nausea health
problems can be caused by poor IAQ People have been
staying indoors for the last two years as a result of the Covid
19 restriction and indoor air pollution in homes  
and hospitals has skyrocketed  With this exceptionacircumstance IAQ improvement is both vital and challenging

Rapid progress in adversarial learning has enabled the generation of realisticlooking fake visual content To distinguish
between fake and real visual content several detection techniques have been proposed The performance of most of these
techniques however drops off signicantly if the test and the training data are sampled from different distributions This
motivates efforts towards improving the generalization of fake detectors Since current fake content generation techniques
do not accurately model the frequency spectrum of the natural images we observe that the frequency spectrum of the fake
visual data contains discriminative characteristics that can be used to detect fake content We also observe that the
information captured in the frequency spectrum is different from that of the spatial domain Using these insights we
propose to complement frequency and spatial domain features using a twostream convolutional neural network archi
tecture called TwoStreamNet We demonstrate the improved generalization of the proposed twostream network to severaunseen generation architectures datasets and techniques The proposed detector has demonstrated signicant performance

technological advancements in articiagence AI have led to various benecial applications in
vision language and speech processing However at the
these technologies may be

exploited by adversaries for illegal or harmful uses For
example Deepfakesa portmanteau of the terms deep
learning and fakemay be used to produce or alter
photorealistic audiovisual content with the help of deep
learning for an illegal or harmful purpose Deepfake
technology enables one to effectively synthesize realistic
looking fake audio or video of a real person speaking and
performing in any arbitrary way  The term Deepfake
was rst coined by a Reddit community for synthetically
replacing the face of a person with the face of another
person The term expanded with time to include similar
techniques such as LipSync 2 3 facial expression
reenactment 46 fullbody and background manipulation
as well as audio synthesis 712NThe rise of technology such as Deepfake has eroded the
traditional condence in the authenticity of audio and video
as any digital content audio video text can be easily
subverted using advanced deep learning techniques for
synthesizing images trained on readily accessible public
videos and images 1316 The gravity and urgency of the
Deepfake threat can be gauged by noting that in recent
times a CEO was scammed using Deepfake audio for
243000 Recent research shows that neural networks can be used
for detecting fake content 1822 These methods however
require a large amount of fake and real training data to
accurately learn the data distributions of both classes The
performance of these methods drops signicantly on the
unseen fake data if sampled from a different distribution or
a different generation process It is because the underlying
model may overt the available training data and therefore
lose its ability to generalize to unseen data To enable the
model to classify previously unseen data will require a
large amount of data from the new distribution which may
not always be available in such problems Attackers and
defenders are continuously improving their approaches and
rolling out new attacks and defenses Therefore it may be
very difcult to collect a large amount of fake data for new
manipulation techniques Ideally for such scenarios a fake
content detector is needed that should be able to detect fake
data without explicit training on that particular type of fake
contentNataraj et acombine the artifacts from the spatial domain and show
through extensive experiments that this technique gener
alizes well on many unseen test setsIn the current work we propose a twostream network
for fake visual content detection The rst stream called
Spatial Stream detects the fake data employing RGB
images while the second stream dubbed as Frequency
Stream utilizes a combination of DFT and DWT for dis
criminating fake and real visual content The frequency
stream exploits the fact that the distribution of the fre
quency spectrum of the fake visual data remains distinct
from the distribution of the real data frequency spectrumThis is illustrated in Fig 1 which shows the DFTmagni
tude spectrum for a sample of real and fake images It can
be seen that the frequency spectrum has patterns that are
different from that of real images These differences are
used to classify the fake versus real content To elaborate
the frequency spectrum differences further we have shown
the average spectra of the fake and real images fromdifferent GAN generators Following the method used by
 we used all the images available in our test set to
calculate the spectrum on the high passed ltered images
and then took the average Fig 2 Since the information
captured by the frequency stream is different from the
information captured by the spatial stream both these
streams complement each other and fusing them can
provide better performance and generalization to unseen
fake data detection To the best of our knowledge this is
the rst work that studies crossmodal information fusion
to improve fake content detection generalizationThe main contributions of this paper are summarizednext1 A novel twostream architecture for fake visual content
detection consisting of a Spatial Stream SS and a
Frequency Stream FS is proposed The SS learns the

visual content in the spatial space using RGB imagesFAKEREAFig 1 DFTmagnitude spectrum for

understand the stateoftheart solutions in image forensicsWe have divided this section into four subsections We
begin with a brief overview of the handcrafted image

discuss methods that focus on improving generalizationFinally we conclude the section by covering the stateof
theart frequencydomain techniques that are specically
designed for image forensic applications21 Handcrafted image forensicsA variety of methods are available in the literature for
detecting traditional image manipulation techniques Most
of these manipulations are designed with the help of image
editing tools The traditional techniques make use of hand
crafted features to detect specic clues that are created as a
result of different manipulations For example severablind noise estimation algorithms have been proposed to
detect region splicing forgeries 26 27 Popescu et al image forensics22 Deep learning based image forensicsDue to the success of deep learning in different elds

critical for its success in realworld applications where the
fake content may be generated by unknown processes We
propose a generalizable fake detection model based on a
twostream convolutional network architecture shown in
FigThe proposed architecture is motivated by the excellent
performance of twostream networks in action recognition
in videos To the best of our knowledge the proposed
network performs quite well on both seen and unseen data
and has outperformed existing stateoftheart SOTAmethods in a wide range of experiments as we shall discuss

into a nonoverlapping block of size 8 cid4 8 pixels and a
transformation is applied on each block independently The
resulting coefcients are then concatenated back to obtain
the arrays of the original image size The output of the DFT

the DWT converts one input channel into 4 output channels

of input channels in the frequency stream is larger as

the class probability averaging fusion method In this

strate that 8cid48 block size has consistently outperformed
other block sizes Therefore transforming the image to the
frequency domain using 8cid48 blocks for DFT is more
effective for fake image detection52 Effect of block size53 Effect of colorspaceWe study the effect of using different block sizes instead of
computing DFT over the whole image In Table 6 we haveTable 5 Evaluation of DFT and DWT combination for fake image

it for fake content
expensive Therefore to implement
detection in realtime applications using video data may be
a potentiathis limitation can be
overcome by using parallel computation of DFT and DWTFigure 6B shows failure cases of the proposed algorithm
which are the result of nondiscriminative frequency
domain features Please note that these fake images are
high quality and very hard to discriminate even for
humansTable 7 The compassion of fake detection performance using RGB

6918DatasetStarGAN SITD StyleGAN2 Whichfaceisreal Deepfake IMLE 6 ConclusionsThis paper addresses the problem of fake image detectionFor this purpose a twostream network is proposed con
sisting of a spatial stream and a frequency stream The
proposed method generalizes to unseen fake image gener
ator distributions much better than the current stateofthe
art approaches The proposed method is also found to be
more robust to the common image perturbations including
blur and JPEG compression artifacts The improved per
formance is leveraged by combining two types of fre
quency domain transformations namely Discrete Fourier
Transform DFT and Discrete Wavelet Transform DWTBoth transformations are applied upon YCbCr colorspace
and different frequency domain channels are concatenated
to discriminate fake images from the real ones By
exploiting the differences between the real and the fake
image frequency responses improved fake detection per
formance is achieved In the future we aim to extend this
work for fake video and audio detectionFunding The authors did not receive support from any organization

bling millions of users to connect and interact This has ledto sharing ideas getting exposed to different ideologies andabsorbing information at an unprecedented pace Out of athese services and apps WhatsApp is the most popular andwidely used medium of communication This has created aclosed social network of more than 15 billion users Apartfrom having a huge user base it also has the most activeusers at a time out of all the social networks Two BillionUsersThis makes WhatsApp a very important medium for anal
ysis as it is a major tool for opinion formation and sociaexchange Due to its endtoend encryption it is becoming amedium of choice for antigovernment movements sharingof radical ideas and gang operations UK says WhatsApp2017 Similarly WhatsApp is also used for the propagationof antisocial behavior A study on Brazils WhatsApp usersResende etal 2019a revealed how WhatsApp can be aneffective tool for the spread of disinformation A study con
ducted in India Saha etal 2021 revealed the spread of hatespeech and Islamophobia on WhatsApp These problems areexacerbated by the fact that content moderation in What
sApp is rather limited The content of a group is only mod
erated by the groups administrators Admins have very fewVo5  Page 2 ofSocial Network Analysis and Miningtools at hand either restrict who can post content or removecertain users from the group Group admins cannot even dothe simple moderation task of deleting a users post As aresult the moderation abilities on WhatsApp are very scantThis work is an extended version of our earlier prelimi
nary analysis of COVID19related messages being dis
seminated across public WhatsApp groups by Pakistaniusers Javed etal 2020 In this extended version in addi
tion to looking at the type of messages being disseminatedacross COVID19 in Pakistani WhatsApp groups we alsotry to understand the impact that political affiliation has ona groups overall sentiment related to COVID19 and thetypes of messages being propagated Our main researchquestions areRQ1  What type of messages about COVID19 are dis
seminated in public WhatsApp groups of Pakistan
RQ2  What is the general user behavior when sharing amessage Specifically is there a connection between agroups political affiliation and the content that is beingsharedRQIs  there  reciprocation  between  information  dis
semination related to COVID19 over WhatsApp andTwitterRQ4  What type of sentiment is expressed by users whensharing COVID19 messages Does this vary on thebasis of political affiliationTo answer these research questions we have gathered thedata from 227 publicly accessible WhatsApp groups duringJanuary 10 2020April 9 2020 This dataset is the first ofits kind giving us a unique opportunity to analyze COVID
19related discussion from one of the largest countries in theworld involving a multimodal environmentimages andtextand multiple social networking platforms of commu
nicationWhatsApp and TwitterWe start by analyzing the content disseminated in these227  public  groups  and  extract  the  COVID19relatedcontent out of them Extracted content is separated intoimage video text1 documents and links Using our datasetwhich we make publicly available2 we make the followingcontributions  We analyze the groups and messages therein with a focuson political affiliations  We give an overview of how users with different politicaaffinities spread COVID19related messages We alsoshow that on average 14 of the content shared is mis
information  We  give  an  overview  of  the  prevailing  sentiment  ofCOVID19 posts and find that the sentiment is mostlynegative2   Related work21   Misinformation onsocial mediaMany studies have been conducted that gave a special focusto rumors and misinformation prior to the events of the2016 US presidential elections Starbird etal 2014 How
ever the events of the US presidential election have sincetriggered a flurry of work on this topic As a result therehave been many papers attempting to understand the impactsocial media has the amount of misinformation present onit and the amount of exposure users have to this informa

sages for political events in Brazil and India On the con
trary this study tries to understand the impact WhatsApp ishaving on the infodemic in Pakistan while considering thepolitical nature of our groups Since Pakistan is a Muslimmajority country religion is relevant in the daily life of thePakistani citizens3 we offer a first insight into how religionand politics together play a role in this infodemic3   MethodologyWe use a multitude of techniques for data collection annota
tion and analysis of data We also create novel algorithmsto better understand the content being shared The details ofthese methods are discussed below31   Dataset preparationWhatsApp allows its user base to create either public orprivate  WhatsApp  groups  A  private  group  can  only  bejoined through an invite which is sent by the admin himself3   en wikip edia org wiki Impor tance of relig ion by count ry1 35  Page 4 ofSocial Network Analysis and MiningWhereas for the public groups WhatsApp allows users toenable joining these groups by means of an invite URL Thisinvite URL can be shared by any number of users and theusers can join a group by clicking this URL The invite URhas a specific structure of the form chat whats app com Many groups eg for politics sports religion share theseinvite URLs on social networks for easy visibility henceincreasing their community size and reachGroup selection Leveraging the unique structure of pub
lic WhatsApp groups we used Facebook and Google searchto find WhatsApp invite URLs To ensure we find groupsfrom Pakistani political parties the URL was often used inconjunction with a political partys name or Pakistan Wealso used Pakistani IP to ensure Google and Facebook giveresults from Pakistan as a priority We also used the keywordWhatsApp along with political parties names or slogansAll of these queries have been logged for the convenienceof new researchers in this domain and can be found onlineFollowing these techniques we found in total 282 publicPakistani WhatsApp groups A loose criterion was set tomake sure the groups joined are in line with our researchgoals and will provide meaningful value to the overall data
set We manually analyzed a groups bio name and profilepic If any of these were not in line with our research goalsthe group was removed from our dataset Removed groupsmostly were sales purchase groups or groups made onlyfor sharing jokes Furthermore we analyzed the remaininggroups for activity over a week In case a group did not haveany significant activity or the activity was not organic ega sales group they were removed from our dataset Afterthese pruning steps a total of 227 public groups were usedto provide the analysis that followsWhatsApp data collection To join these groups werelied extensively on the tools created and provided byGari

able probability if an account is a bot These features arethen submitted to a random forest for prediction We usedthe service using a Python library provided by the authorsOut of the 470 accounts on Twitter a total of 33 accountswere classified as bots These accounts mostly share correctinformation or religious content This suggests that theseare social bots but are not interested in the spread of misin

are expected to have a profound impact on the vehicular

technology known as vehicular networks or vehicular adhoc
networks VANETs  Over the years various congurations
of connected vehicles have been developed including the use of
dedicated shortrange communications DSRC in the United
States and ITSG5 in Europe based on the IEEE 80211p
standard However a recent study The impressive ability of MLDL to leverage increasingly
accessible data along with the advancement in other concomi

to be set
to enable autonomous and selforganizing con

networks will evolve from normal to autonomous vehicles and
will enable ubiquitous Internet access on vehicles ML wihave a predominant role in building the perception system of
autonomous and semiautonomous connected vehiclesDespite the development of different congurations of con
nected vehicles they are still vulnerable to various security
issues and there are various automotive attack surfaces that
can be exploited  The threat is getting worse with the
development of fully autonomous vehicles As the autonomous
vehicles are being equipped with many sensors such as cam
eras RADAR LIDAR and mechanical control units etcThese sensors share critical sensory information with onboard
devices through CAN bus and with other nearby vehicles as
well The backbone of selfdriving vehicles is the onboard
intelligent processing capabilities using the data collected
through the sensory system This data can be used for many
other purposes eg getting information about vehicle kinetics1553877X ccid2 2020 IEEE Personal use is permitted but republicationredistribution requires IEEE permissionSee  for more information  Restrictions apply TABLECOMPARISON OF THIS PAPER WITH EXISTING SURVEY AND REVIEW PAPERS ON THE SECURITY OF MACHINE LEARNING ML AND CONNECTED ANDAUTONOMOUS VEHICLES CAVS LEGENDMEANS COVERED  MEANS NOT COVERED  MEANS PARTIALLY COVEREDtrafc ow road and network conditions etc Such data can be
potentially used for improving the performance of the vehicu
lar ecosystem using adaptive datadriven decision making and
can also be used to accomplish various destructive objectivesTherefore ensuring data integrity and security are necessarily
important to avoid various risks and attacks on CAVsIt is common for the perception and control systems of
CAVs to be built using MLDL methods However MLDtechniques have been recently found vulnerable to carefully
crafted adversarial perturbations ML in general and DL schemes specically perform excep
tionally wein learning hidden patterns from data Dschemes such as deep neural networks DNN have out
performed humanlevel intelligence in many perception and
detection tasks by accurately learning from a large corpus
of training data and classifyingpredicting with high accu
racy on unseen realworld test examples As DL schemes
produce outstanding results they have been used in many real
world securitysensitive tasks such as perception system in
selfdriving cars anomaly and intrusion detection in vehicular
networks etc MLDL schemes are designed for benign and
stationary environments where it is assumed that the training
and test data belongs to the same statistical distribution The
application of this assumption in a realworld application is
awed as training and test data can have different statisticadistributions which gives rise to an opening for adversaries
to compromise the MLDLbased systems Furthermore the
lack of interpretability of the learning process imperfectionsin training process and discontinuity in the inputoutput
relationship of DL schemes also resulted in an incentive for
adversaries to fool the deployed MLDL system Contributions of This Paper In this paper we build upon

taxonomy of driving automation that is organized in six lev
els The SAE dened the potential of driving automation at
each level that is depicted in Figure 2 Moreover according
to a recent scientometric and bibliometric review article on
autonomous vehicles  different naming conventions have
been used over the years to refer to autonomous vehiclesThese names are illustrated in Figure 3 note that the year
denotes the publication year of the rst paper mentioning the
corresponding nameThe SAE denes the operational design domain ODD for
the safe operation of autonomous vehicles as the specic
conditions under which a given driving automation system or
feature thereof is designed to function including but not lim
ited to driving modes  ODD refers to the domain of
operation which an autonomous vehicle has to deal with An
ODD representing an ability to drive in good weather condi
tions is quite different from an ODD that embraces all kinds
of weather and lighting conditions The SAE recommends
that ODD should be monitored at runtime to gauge if theB Development of Autonomous Vehicles HistoricaOverviewSelfdriving vehicles especially ones considering lower lev
els of automation referring to the taxonomy of automation as
presented in Figure 2 have existed for a long time In 1925
Francis Udina presented a remote controlled car famously
known as American wonder In the 19391940 New York
Worlds Fair General Motors Futurama exhibited aspects of
what we call selfdriving car today General Motors and RCA
initiated the rst work around the design and development of
selfdriving vehicles in the early 1950s In 1986 Ernst Dickens at University of Munich designed a
robotic van that can drive autonomously without trafc and by
1987 the robotic van drove up to 60 Kmhr Later he started the
development of driving scenes recognition tools using video
imagery   Restrictions apply Fig 2 The taxonomy of the levels of automation in drivingTABLELIST OF ACRONYMSFig 3 The illustration of different naming conventions used for referring

DARPA announced the grand autonomous vehicles challenge
and held the rst episode in 2004 The rst grand challenge
was won by Carnegie Mellon University CMU and their car
only drove nearly seven miles where the nish line was at
140 miles In 2005 the second episode of the DARPA grand
challenge was held in which ve out of twentythree teams
were able to reach the nish lineThis time Stanford Universitys vehicle Stanley has won
the challenge In the third episode of DARPA grand challenge
in 2007 universities were invited to present the autonomous
vehicles on busy roads to shift the perception of the public
tech and automobile industries about the design and feasibility
of autonomous vehiclesIn 2007 Google hired the team leads of Stanford and CMautonomous vehicle projects and started pushing towards their
selfdriving car design on the public roads By the year 2010
Googles selfdriving car has navigated approximatelythousand miles on the roads of California in quest of achiev
ing the target of 10 million miles by 2020 In 2013 VisLabV2V communications This work has paved the way for mod
ern adaptive cruise control and automated emergency braking

grams like the PATH Program by Caltrans and the University
of California in 1986 in particular the work on selfdriving

completed the international autonomous driving challenge by
driving two orange vans 15000 km with minimal driver inter
ventions from University of Parma in Italy to Shanghai in
China A year later in 2014 Volvo demonstrated the road
train concept where one vehicle controls several other vehicles

achieved the 10 million miles target It is expected that by
2020 the state departments of motor vehicles DMV may

transportation will also become driverless and by 2030 it is

puter systems comprising millions of lines of code executing
on tens of heterogeneous processors with rich connectivity
provided by internal networks eg CAN  While this
structure has offered signicant efciency safety and cost
benets it has also created the opportunity for new attacksEnsuring the integrity and security of vehicular systems is
crucial as they are intended to provide road safety and are
essentially life criticaDifferenttypes of attacks on vehicular networks aredescribed below1 Application Layer Attacks The application layer attacks
affect the functionality of a specic vehicular application such
as beaconing and message spoong Application layer attacks  Restrictions applyIEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS  TUTORIALS VOL 22 NO 2 SECOND QUARTERcan be broadly classied as integrity or authenticity attacks
and are briey described belowa Integrity Attacks In the message fabrication attack the
adversary continuously listens to the wireless medium
and upon receiving each message fabricates its con
tent accordingly and rebroadcasts it
to the networkModication of each message may have a different effect
on the system state and depends solely on the design of
the longitudinal control system A comprehensive sur
vey on attacks on the fundamental security goals ie
condentiality integrity and availability can be found
in  In the spoong attack the adversary imitates
another vehicle in the network to inject falsied messages
into the target vehicle or a specic vehicle preceding the
target Therefore the physical presence of the attacker
close to the target vehicle is necessarily not requiredIn a recent study  the use of onboard ADAS sen
sors is proposed for the detection of location spoong
attack in vehicular networks A similar type of attack
in a vehicular network can be GPS spoongjamming
attack b Authenticity Attacks Authenticity is another major chal
lenge in vehicular networks which refers to protecting
the vehicular network from inside and outside mali
cious vehicles possessing falsied identity by denying
their access to the system  There are two types of
authenticity attacks namely Sybil attack and imperson
ation attacks  In a Sybil attack a malicious vehicle
pretends many fake identities To avoid application layer attacks various cryptographic
approaches can be effectively leveraged especially when an
attacker is a malicious outsider  For instance digitasignatures can be used to ensure messages integrity and to
protect them against unauthorized use  In addition dig
ital signatures can potentially provide both data and entity
level authentication Moreover to prevent replay attacks a
timestampbased random number nonce can be embed
ded within messages While the aforementioned methods are
general there are other unprecedented challenges related to
vehicular networks implementation deployment and stan
dardization For example protection against security threatsbecomes more challenging with the presence of a trusted
compromised vehicle with a valid certicate In such cases
datadriven anomaly detection methods can be used  A survey on anomaly detection for enhancing the security of
connected vehicles is presented in 2 Network Layer Attacks Network layer attacks are dif
ferent from the application layer attacks in a way that they can
be launched in a distributed manner One prominent example
of such attacks on vehicular systems is the use of vehicular
botnets to attempt a denial of service DoS or distributed
denial of service DDoS attack The potential of vehicu
lar networkbased botnet attack for autonomous vehicles is
presented in  The study demonstrates that such an attack
can cause severe physical congestion on hot spot road seg
ments resulting in an increased trip duration of vehicles in the
target area Another way to realize the DoS attack is to use
network jamming that causes disruption in the communications
network over a small or large geographic area As discussed
earlier current congurations of vehicular networks are based
on the IEEE 80211p standard that uses single control chan
nel CCH with multiple service channels SCH and can be
attacked by attempting single channel or multichannel jam
ming by swiping between all channels Various conventionatechniques can be adopted to mitigate network layer attacks
such as frequency hopping channel and technology switching
etc Coalition or platooning attack is a similar type of attack
in which a group of compromised vehicles can cooperate to
perform malicious activities such as blocking or interrupting
communications between legitimate vehicles3 System Level Attacks The attacks on the vehicles hard
ware and software are known as system level attacks and can
be performed by either malicious insiders at the time of devel
opment or outsiders using unattended vehicular access Such
attacks are more serious in nature as they can cause damage
even in the presence of the deployed state of the art secu
rity measures and secure endtoend communications  For
instance if the onboard hardware or software system of a
vehicle is maliciously modied then the information exchange
between the vehicle and communication systems will be inac
curate and with such a phenomenon the overall performance
and security of the vehicular network will be compromisedIn  authors investigated a noninvasive sensor spoong
attack on cars antilock braking system such that the braking
system mistakenly reports a specic velocity4 Privacy BreachesIn vehicular networks vehicles
broadcast safety messages periodically that contain criticainformation such as vehicle identity current location veloc
ity acceleration etc The adversary can exploit such kind of
information by attempting an eavesdropping attack which is
a type of passive attack and is more difcult to be detectedTherefore preserving the privacy of vehicles and drivers is
of utmost importance This allows the vehicles to commu
nicate with each other without disclosing their identities
which is accomplished by masking their identities eg using
pseudonyms In vehicular networks knowing the origin of
the message is crucial for authentication purposes therefore
vehicles should be equipped with privacypreserving authen
tication mechanism ensuring that the communication among  Restrictions apply vehicles V2V and with infrastructure V2I is condentiaHowever intervehicular communication can be eavesdropped
by anyone within the radio range eg a malicious vehicle
can collect and misuse condential information Similarly an
attacker can construct location proles of vehicles by establish
ing a connection with the RSU Therefore the effectiveness of
pseudonymous or even complete anonymous schemes in vehic
ular networks remains vulnerable to privacy breaches 5 Sensors Attacks Although sensors of autonomous vehi
cles are by design resilient to environmental noises such as
acoustical interference from nearby objects and vehicles etcHowever current sensors cannot resist intentional noise and
it can be injected to realize various attacks such as jamming
and spoong6 Attacks on Perception System The perception system
of selfdriving vehicles is developed using various computer
vision techniques including modern MLDLbased methods
for identifying objects eg pedestrians trafcs signs and
symbols etc The perception system of selfdriving vehicle
is highly vulnerable to the physical world and adversariaattacks For example suppose were learning a controller f xto predict the steering angle in an autonomous car as a func
tion of the visionbased input captured into a feature vector
x The adversary may introduce small manipulations ie x is
modied into x cid4 such that the predicted steering angle f x cidis maximally distant from the optimal angle y7 Intrusion Detection The detection of malicious activ
ities is one of the major challenges of VANETs Intrusion
detection systems enable the identication of various types of
attacks being performed on the system eg sink and black
hole attacks etc Without such a system communication in
vehicular networks is highly vulnerable to numerous attacks
such as selective forwarding rushing and Sybil attacks etcTo detect the selective forwarding attack a trust system based
method utilizing local and global detection of attacks among
internodes mutual monitoring and detection of abnormal driv
ing patterns is presented in  Alheeti et al proposed a
system for intelligent intrusion detection of gray holes and
rushing attack 8 Certicate Revocation The security mechanism of
vehicular networks is based on trusted certication authority
CA that manages the identities and credentials of the vehicles
by issuing valid certicates to them The vehicles are essen
tially unable to operate in the system without a valid certicate
and validity of certicate must be revoked after a certain
amount of time The revocation process is a challenging task
administratively due to challenges such as the identication of
nodes with illegitimate behavior and the need to change the
registered domain Moreover it is necessary to restrain mali
cious nodes by revoking their certicates to prevent them from
attacking the system To tackle this problem three different
certicate revocation protocols have been proposed in E NonSecurityRelated Challenges in Deploying CAVsThe phenomenon of connected vehicles is realized using
a technology named vehicular networks which have variouschallenges that need to be addressed for their efcient deploy
ment in the longer term that are described below1 High Mobility of Nodes The large scale mobility of
vehicles in vehicular networks result in a highly dynamic
topology thus raising several challenges for the communica
tion networks  In addition the dynamic nature of trafc
can lead to a partitioned network having isolated clusters
of nodes  As the connections between the vehicles and
nearby RSUs are shortlived the wireless channel coherence
time is short This makes accurate realtime channel estima
tion more challenging at the receiver end This necessitates the
design of dynamic and robust resource management protocols
that can efciently utilize available resources while adapting
to the vehicular density variations In
2 Heterogeneous and Stringent QoS Requirementsvehicular networks there are different modes of communi
cations that can be broadly categorized into V2V and Vcommunications In V2V communications vehicles exchange
safetycritical information eg information beacons road and
trafc conditions among each other known as basic safety
messages BSM This communication which can be per
formed periodically or when triggered by some event requires
high reliability and is sensitive to delay In V2I communications on the other hand vehicles can
communicate with nearby communications infrastructure to
get support for route planning
trafc information opera
tional data and to access entertainment services that requires
more bandwidth and frequent access to the Internet eg for
downloading highquality maps and accessing infotainment
services etc Therefore the heterogeneous and stringent QoS
requirements of VANETs cannot be simultaneously met with
traditional wireless design approaches3 Learning Dynamics of Vehicular Networks As dis
cussed above vehicular networks exhibit high dynamicity
thus to meet the realtime and stringent requirements of vehic
ular networks historical datadriven predictive strategies can
be adopted eg traditional methods like hidden Markov mod
els HMM and Bayesian methods  In addition to using
traditional ML methods more sophisticated DL models can
be used for example recurrent neural networks RNN and
long short term memory LSTM have been shown beneciafor time series data and can be potentially used for modeling
temporal dynamics of vehicular networks4 Network Congestion Control Vehicular networks are
geographically unbounded and can be developed for a city
several cities and countries as well The unbounded nature
of vehicular networks leads to the challenge of network con
gestion  As the trafc density is high in urban areas as
compared to rural areas particularly during rush hours that
can possibly lead to network congestion issueslays out5 Time Constraints The efcient application of vehic
ular networks requires hard realtime guarantees because

benet from ML can be broadly categorized into the following
four major components as shown in Figure1 Perception assists in perceiving the nearby environmentand recognizing objects2 Prediction predicting the actions of perceived objects
ie how environmental actors such as vehicles and
pedestrians will move3 Planning route planning of vehicle ie how to reachfrom point A to B4 Decision Making  Control making decisions relating
to vehicle movement ie how to make the longitudinaand lateral decisions to control and steer the vehicleThese components are combined to develop a feedback
system for enabling the phenomenon of selfdriving without
any human intervention This ML pipeline can then facili
tate autonomous realtime decisions by leveraging insights
from the diverse types of data eg vehicles behav

ioral patterns network topology vehicleskinetics information etc that can be in easily gathered
by CAVsIn the remainder of this section we will discuss some of
the most prominent applications of MLbased methods for
performing these tasks a summary is presented in TableA Applications of ML for the Perception Task in CAVsDifferent ML techniques particularly DL models have
widely been used for developing the perception system of
autonomous vehicles  In addition to using video cam
eras as major visionary sensors these vehicles also use other
sensors for detection of different events in the cars surround
ings eg RADAR and LIDAR The surrounding environment
of the autonomous vehicles is perceived in two stages In the rst stage the whole road is scanned for the detec
tion of changes in the driving conditions such as trafc
signs and lights pedestrian crossing and other obstacles etcIn the second stage knowledge about the other vehicles is
acquired In  a CNN model is trained for developing direct
perception representation of autonomous vehicles  Restrictions applyB Applications of ML for the Prediction Task in CAVsIn CAVs accurate and timely prediction of different events
encountered in driving scenes is another important task which
is mainly accomplished using different ML and DL algo
rithms For instance autonomous vehicles uses DL models
for the detection and localization of obstacles  different
objects eg vehicles pedestrians and bikes etc C Applications of ML for the Planning Task in CAVsCAVs are equipped with onboard data processing com
patibilities and they intelligently process the data collected
from heterogeneous sensors for efcient route planning and
for other optimized operations using different ML and Dtechniques The key goal of route planning is to reach the
destination in a small amount of time while avoiding trafc
congestion potholes and other vehicles by navigating through
GPS and consuming less fuel as possible In the literature
motion planning of autonomous vehicles is studied in three
dimensions 1 nding a path for reaching destination point
2 searching for the fastest manoeuvre and 3 determining
the most feasible trajectory  Moreover to avoid collisions
between vehicles in CAVs predicting the trajectories of other
vehicles is a crucial task for the planning trajectory of an
autonomous vehicle  For instance Li presented a hybrid
approach to model uncertainty in vehicle trajectory prediction
for CAVs application using deep learning and kernel density
estimation D Applications of ML for the Decision Making and ControIn recent years DL based algorithms have been exten
sively used for control of autonomous vehicles that are rened
through millions of kilometers of test drives For instance
Bojarski et al presented a CNN based endtoend learning
framework for selfdriving cars  The model was able to
drive the car on local roads with or without markings and on
highways with small training data In a similar study CNN is
trained for endtoend learning of lane keeping for autonomous
cars  Recently researchers have now started working
on utilizing deep reinforcement learning RL for perform
ing actions and decision making in driving conditions Bouton et al proposed a generic approach to enforce prob
abilistic guarantees on RL learning for which they derived
an exploration strategy that restricts the RL agent to choose
among only those actions that satisfy a desired probabilistic
specication criteria prior to training  Moreover human
like speed control of autonomous vehicles using deep RL with
double Qlearning is presented in approach for dynamic orchestration of networking caching
and computing resources for connected vehiclesIn addition MLbased methods have been used for many
other applications in CAVs For example adaptive trafc ow
in which smart infrastructure integrates V2V signals from the
moving cars to optimize speed limits trafclight timing and
the number of lanes in each direction on the basis of the actuatrafc load The trafc ow can be further improved in CAVs
by using cooperative adaptive cruise control technology Also vehicles can take advantage of cruise control and save
fuel by following one another in the form of vehicles pla
toons Moreover DL based methods have been proposed for
intrusion detection for invehicle security of CAN bus The overview of intelligent and connected vehicles current
and future perspectives are presented in Autonomous vehicles are evolving through four stages of
development The rst stage includes passive warning and
convenience systems such as front and backward facing cam
eras crosstrafc warning mechanism radar for blind spot
detection etc These warning systems use different computer
vision and machine learning techniques to perceive the sur
rounding views of the vehicle on the road and to recognize
trafc signs static and moving objects In the second stage
these systems are used to assist the active control system of
the vehicle while parking braking and to prevent backing
over unseen objects In the third stage the vehicle is equipped
with some semiautonomous operationsas the vehicle may
behave unexpectedly and the on seat driver should be able to
resume control In the nal stage the vehicle is designed to
perform fully autonomous operationsCAVs together formulate the settings of the selfdriving
vehicular network and there is a strong synergy between
them  In addition autonomous vehicles are an important
component of future vehicular networks that are equipped
with complex sensory equipment The autonomous vehicu
lar networks are predictive and adaptive to their environments
and are designed with two fundamental goals ie autonomy
and interactivity The rst goal enables the network to mon
itor plan and control itself and the later ensures that the
infrastructure is transparent and friendly to interact withThe deployment of ML in CAVs entails the followingstagesa Data Collection Input data is collected using sen
sors or from other digital repositories In autonomous
vehicles input data is collected using a complex sen
sory network eg cameras RADAR GPS etc see

onomy of adversarial examples perturbation methods and
benchmarks is presented in Figurex  x  arg mincid2cid2  f x    t1 Adversarial Attacks An adversarial attack affecting the
training phase of the learning process is termed as poisoning
attack where an attacker compromises the learning process of
the MLDL scheme by manipulating the training data 
whereas the adversarial attack on the inference phase of the
learning process is termed as evasion attack where an attacker
manipulates the test data or realtime inputs to the deployed
model for producing a false result  Usually examples used
for fooling the MLDL schemes at inference time are called
adversarial examplesFormally adversarial examples are dened as inputs to a
deployed MLDL model created by an attacker by adding an2 Adversarial Perturbations The adversarial perturbation
crafting is divided in three major categories namely loca  Restrictions apply search combinatorial optimization and convex relaxationThis division is based on solving the objective function given
in Eq 1 Local search is the most common method of gener
ating adversarial perturbations where the adversarial examples
are generated by solving the objective function provided in
Eq 1 to obtain a lower bound on the adversarial perturbation
by using gradientbased methods A prime example of locasearch adversarial example crafting is the fast gradient sign
method FGSM where an adversarial example is created by
taking a step in the direction of the gradient  In another
study the authors demonstrated that adversarial images are
very easy to be constructed using evolutionary algorithms
or gradient ascent  Combinatorial optimization is also
a method for creating adversarial examples where we nd
the exact solution of the optimization problem provided in
Eq 1 a major shortcoming of this method is the increase in
the computational complexity with the increase of the num
ber of examples in the dataset Recently Khalil et al 3 Different Aspects of Perturbations The adversariaexamples are designed to look like the original ones and
imperceptible to humans In this regard the addition of smaperturbations is of utmost importance Whereas the literature
suggests that even onepixel perturbation is often sufcient to
fool the deep model trained for classication task  Here
we analyze different aspects of adversarial perturbationsa Perturbation Scope Adversarial perturbations are gen
erated from two aspects1 perturbations for each
legitimate input and 2 universal perturbations for the
complete datasets ie for each original cleaned sampleTo date most of the studies considered the rst scope of
adversarial perturbationsb Perturbation Limitation Similarly there are two types of
limitations optimizing the system at a low perturbations
scale and optimizing the system at a low perturbations
scale with constrained optimizationc The magnitude of the perturbations is mainly measured
using three norms L2 L and L0 norm In L2norm
based attacks the attacker aims to minimize the squared
error between the original and adversarial example L2
norm measures the Euclidean distance between the adver
sarial example and the original sample and results in a
very small amount of noise added to the adversarial sam
ple L attacks are perhaps the simplest type of attacks
which aim to limit or minimize the extent to which the
maximum change for all pixels in adversarial examples is
achieved Also this constraint forces to only make very
small changes to each pixel L0normbased attacks work
by minimizing the number of perturbed pixels in an image
and force the modications only to very few pixelsTo ensure tightly constrained action space available to an
adversary imperceptibility of perturbations is important todevelop an attack Considering the important constraintswhat constraints are placed on the attackers starting point
and 2 where did this initial example come from Gilmer et aidentied four salient features described below of adversariaperturbations a Indistinguishable Perturbation The attacker does not
have to select a starting point but it is given a draw from
the data distribution and introduces such perturbation in
the input sample that is indistinguishable by a humanb ContentPreserving Perturbation The attacker does not
have to select a starting point but it is given a draw from
the data distribution and creates such perturbation as long
as the original content of the sample is preservedc Nonsuspicious Input The attacker can generate any type
of desired perturbed input sample as long as it remains
undetectable to a humand ContentConstrained Input The attacker can generate any
type of desired perturbed input sample as long as it
maintains some content payload ie it must be a pic
ture of dog but not necessarily a particular dog This
includes payloadconstrained input where human percep
tion might not be important Rather the intended function
of the input example remains intacte Unconstrained Input There is no constraint on the input
and an attacker can produce any type of input example
to get the desired output or behavior from the systemIn this4 Adversarial ML Benchmarkssection we
describe the benchmarks datasets and victim ML models used
for evaluating adversarial examples Researchers mostly adopt
an inconsistent approach and report the performance of the
attacks on diverse datasets and victim models The widely used

mon and straight forward questions related to the system being
developed or deployed from a hypothetical attackers point of
view Threat modeling is a fundamental component of security
analysis It requires that some fundamental questions related
to the threat are addressed  In particular a threat modeshould identify the system principals what is the system and who are thestakeholders the system goals what does the system intend to do

by a defender to ensure the robustness of MLbased autonomous systemThe key goal of threat modeling is to optimize the secu
rity of the system by determining security goals identifying
potential threats and vulnerabilities and to develop counter
measures for preventing or mitigating their associated effects
on the system Answering these questions requires careflogical thoughts and signicant expertise and timeAs the focus of this paper is on highlighting the potentiavulnerabilities of using ML techniques in CAVs the scope of
our study is restricted to the adversarial ML threat in CAVs In
the remainder of this section we discuss the various facets of
the adversarial ML threats in CAVs a taxonomy aggregating
these issues is illustrated in Figure1 Adversarial Attack Type In the literature the attacks
on learning systems are generally categorized into three
dimensions a Inuence Itincludes causative trying to get controover
training data and exploratory exploiting mis
classications of the model without affecting the training
process attacksb Specicity It involves targeted and indiscriminate attackson a specic instancec Security Violation It is concerned with the integrity ofassets and availability of the service attackThe rst dimension describes the capabilities of the adver
sary and whether the attacker has the ability to affect the
learning by poisoning training data Instead

exploits the model by sending new samples and observing
their responses to get the intended behavior The second axis
indicates the specic intentions of the attacker ie whether
the attacker is interested in realizing a targeted attack on one
particular sample or he aims to cause learned model t fail in an
indiscriminate fashion The third dimension detail the types of
security violation an attacker can cause eg the attacker may
aim to bypass harmful messages to bypass through the lter as
false negatives or realizing denial of service by causing benign
samples misclassied as false positivesthe optimization technique2 Adversarial Knowledge Based on the adversariaknowledge available to the adversaries the adversarial Mattacks are divided into three types namely whitebox gray
box and blackbox attacks Whitebox attacks assume com
plete knowledge about the underlying ML model including


ML model model architecture activation function hyper
parameters layer weights and training data Graybox attacks
assume a partial knowledge about the targeted model whereas
the blackbox adversarial attack assumes the adversary has
zero knowledge and no access to the underlying ML modeand the training data Black box attack refers to the real
world knowledge where there is not much information about
the targeted MLDL scheme is available In such cases the
adversary acts as a normal user and tries to infer from
the output of the ML system Blackbox adversarial attacks
make use of transferability property of adversarial exam
ples where it is assumed that adversarial examples created
for one MLDL model will affect other models trained on
datasets with a similar distribution to that of the originamodel 3 Adversarial Capabilities Adversarial capabilities are
important to be identied in security practice As they dene
the strength of the adversaries to compromise the security
of the system In general an adversary can be stronger or
weaker based on the knowledge and access to the systemAdversarial capabilities advocate how and what type of attacks
an adversary can realize using what type of attack vector on
which attack surface The attacks can be launched at two
main phases namely inference and training Inference time
attacks are exploratory attacks that do not modify the under
lying model Instead they inuence it to produce incorrect
outputs Inference attacks vary with the availability of system
knowledge The training time attacks aim at tampering with
the model itself or inuence its learning process and involve
two types of attack methods  In the rst type adversaria  Restrictions apply examples are injected in the training data and in the second
type training data is directly modied4 Adversarial Specicity Another classication of the
adversarial attacks is based on the specicity of the adver
sarial examples where adversarial attacks are classied as
targeted and nontargeted attacks The attacks where adversar
ial perturbations are added to compromise the performance of
a specic class in the data are known as the targeted adversariaattacks Targeted adversarial attacks are launched by adver
saries to create targeted misclassication ie a specic road
sign will be misclassied by the selfdriving vehicle while the
rest of the road sign classication system will function cor
rectly or sourcetarget misclassication ie a certain road
trafc sign will be always classied in a predetermined wrong
class by the road sign classier in a selfdriving vehicleWhereas adversarial perturbations created for deteriorating the
performance of the model irrespective of any class of data
are known as nontargeted adversarial attacks Nontargeted
attacks are launched by adversaries to reduce the classica
tion condence ie a trafc sign will be detected with less
accuracy which was previously detected with high accuracyand misclassication ie a road trafc sign will be classied
in any other class than its original one5 Adversarial Falsication The adversary can attempt
two types of

falsication attacks namely
attacks and false negative attacks  In the rst attack an
adversary generates a negative sample which can be misclas
sied as a positive one Lets assume such attack has been
launched on the image classication system of an autonomous
vehicle A false positive will be an adversarial image pre
dicted to be of a class with high condence to whom it did
not belong and is unrecognizable to humans On the contrary
while attempting false negative attacks the adversary gener
ates a positive sample which can be misclassied as a negative
one In adversarial ML this type of attack is referred to as an
evasion attack6 Attack Frequency The adversarial attacks can be single
step or consist of an iterative optimization process Compared
to single step attacks iterative adversarial attacks are stronger
however they require frequent interactions for querying the
ML system and subsequently require a large amount of time
and computational resources for their efcient generation7 Adversarial Goals The last component of the threat
modeling is the articulation of the adversarys goals The clas
sical approach to model adversarial goals includes modeling of
the adversarys desires to impact the condentiality integrity
and availability known as the CIA model and a fourth yet
important dimension is the privacy C Review of Existing Adversarial ML Attacks1 Adversarial ML Attacks on Conventional ML SchemesA pioneering work on adversarial ML was performed by

ROBUST ML SOLUTIONSAs discussed above despite the outstanding performance
of ML techniques in many settings including human leveaccuracy at recognizing images These techniques exhibit strict
vulnerability to carefully crafted adversarial examples In this
section we present an outline of approaches for developing
adversarially robust ML solutions We dene the robustness as
the ability of the ML model to restrain adversarial examplesIn the literature defenses against adversarial attacks have
been divided into two broad categories 1 reactive detect
adversarial observations input after deep models are trained
and 2 proactive make the deep model robust against adver
sarial examples before the attackAlternatively these techniques can also be broadly divided
into three categories 1 modifying data 2 adding auxil
iary models and 3 modifying models The reader is referred
to Figure 12 for a visual depiction of a taxonomy of robust
ML solutions in which various techniques that fall in these
categories are also listed These categories are detailed nextA Modifying DataThe methods falling under this category mainly deal with
modication of either the training data eg adversariaretraining and its features or
test data eg data pre
processing Widely used approaches that utilize such methods
are described below1 Adversarial ReTraining The training with adversariaexamples has been rstly proposed by Goodfellow et al 2 Input Reconstruction The idea of input reconstruc
tion is to clean the adversarial examples to transform them
back to legitimate ones Once the adversarial examples have
been transformed they will not affect the prediction of DNN
models For robustifying DNN a technique named deep con
tractive autoencoder has been proposed in  They trained
a denoising autoencoder for cleaning adversarial perturbations3 Feature Squeezing Xu et al   Restrictions applyIEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS  TUTORIALS VOL 22 NO 2 SECOND QUARTERTABLE VADVERSARIAL ATTACKS ON SELFDRIVING VEHICLES SUMMARY OF STATEOFTHEART4 Features Masking In  authors proposed to add a
masking layer before the softmax layer of the classier that is
mainly responsible for the classication task The purpose of
adding the masking layer was to mask the most sensitive fea
tures of input that are more prone to adversarial perturbations
by forcing the corresponding weights of this layer to zero5 Developing Adversarially Robust Features This method
has been recently proposed as an effective approach to make
DNNs resilient against adversarial attacks  Authors
leveraged the connections between the natural spectral geo
metrical property of the dataset and the metric of interest
for developing adversarially robust features They empirically
demonstrated that the spectral approach can be effectively used
to generate adversarially robust features that can be ultimately
used to develop robust models6 Manifold Projection In this method input examples are
projected on the manifold of learned data from another Mmodel generally the manifold is provided by a generative
model For instance Song et al of normal examples whereas the reformer network moves
adversarial examples towards the learned manifoldB Modifying ModeThe methods that fall in this category mainly modify the
parametersfeatures learned by the trained model eg defen

that provides guaranteed robustness
adversariaattacksagainstIn a5 Explainable and Interpretable Mrecent
study  an adversarial example detection approach is
presented for a face recognition task that leverages the inter
pretability of DNN models The key in this approach is
the identication of critical neurons for an individual task
that is performed by establishing a bidirectional correspon
dence inference between the neurons of a DNN model and
its attributes Then the activation values of these neurons are
amplied to augment the reasoning part and the values of
other neurons are decreased to conceal the uninterpretable partRecently Nicholas Carlini showed that this approach does not
defend against untargeted adversarial perturbations generated
using L norm with a bound of 001 6 Masking ML Model In a recent study  authors
formulated the problem of adversarial ML as learning and
masking problem and presented a classier masking method
for secure learning To mask the deep model they introduced

low distortion attacks  Restrictions applyIEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS  TUTORIALS VOL 22 NO 2 SECOND QUARTERC Adding Auxiliary ModelsThese methods aim to utilize additional ML models to
enhance the robustness of the main model eg using gen
erative models for adversarial detection such widely used
methods are described as follows1 Adversarial Detection In adversarial detection strategy
a binary classier detector is trained eg DNN to identify
the input as a legitimate or an adversarial one  In  authors used a simple DNNbased binary adversar
ial detector as an auxiliary network to the main model In a
similar study  authors introduced an outlier class while
training the DNN model the model then detects the adversar
ial examples by classifying them as an outlier This defense
approach has been used in a number of studies in the literature2 Ensembling Defenses As adversarial examples can be
developed in a multifacet fashion therefore multiple defense
methods can be combined together parallelly or sequentiallyto defend against them  PixelDefend 3 Using Generative ML Models Goodfellow et al D Potential of Adversarial Defenses for CAVsThe adversarial defense methods described in the above
sections are general ie they are developed to make DNN
resilient against adversarial attacks However these methods
have a great potential to be used for the robust application
of DL models in CAVs settings and can be used for robus
tifying various applications as described in Section III of
MLDL in CAVs ecosystem For instance defense methodsFig 13 The taxonomy of different adversarial defense evaluation methods
and recommendationsaiming at robustifying the DNN classier can be used for
developing adversarially robust objection detection systemsAlso in CAVs the presence of adversaries who may want to
harm the CAVs environment is more common eg consider
an adversary trying to get the control of the autonomous car
in an attempt to force the vehicle to cause an accident etcand the above mentioned general adversarial defense methods
can provide robustness to MLDL applications in CAVsHowever more research is needed to design implement and
experiment with new adversarial defenses that are customized
from the groundup for CAVs Such defenses should bene

taking CAVs safety delay and computational constraints into
considerations We believe that such defenses can hasten the
deployment of ML models in practical CAVs settingsE Adversarial Defense Evaluation Methods and

recent study  Carlini et al provided recommendations
for evaluating adversarial defenses and thereby provided three
common reasons to evaluate the performance of adversariadefenses These recommendations are briey described belowa Defending against the adversary Defending against
adversaries attempting adversarial attacks on the system is
crucial as it is a matter of security concern In realworld
applications if the MLbased systems are deployed without
considering the security threats then the adversaries willing to
harm the system will continue to practice attacking the system
as long as there are incentives The nature and sovereignty
of attacks vary with adversarial capabilities and knowledge
etc In this regard proper and wellthought threat modeling
described in detail in an earlier section is of paramount
importance  Restrictions apply TABLE VSUMMARY OF STATEOFTHEART ADVERSARIAL DEFENSE APPROACHESb Testing worstcase robustness In realworld settings
testing the worstcase robustness of ML models from the
perspective of an adversary is crucial as realworld systemsexhibit randomness that is hard to be predicted Compared
to the random testing approach worstcase analysis can be a
powerful tool to distinguish a system that fails one time in  Restrictions applyIEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS  TUTORIALS VOL 22 NO 2 SECOND QUARTERa billion trials from a system that never fails For instance
if a powerful adversary who is attempting to harm a system
to get intentional misbehavior fails to do so then it provides
strong evidence that the system will not misbehave in case of
previously unforeseen randomnessc Measuring progress of ML towards human leveabilities To advance ML techniques it is important to under
stand why ML algorithms fail in a particular setting In the
literature we see that the performance gap between ML meth
ods and humans is considerably small on many complex tasks
eg natural image classication  mastering the game
of Go using reinforcement learning  and human leveaccuracy in the medical domain   However in
case of evaluating adversarial robustness the performance gap
between humans and ML systems is very large This is so true
for the cases where ML models exhibit superhuman accuracy
ie an adversarial attack can completely evade the prediction
performance of the system This leads to the belief that there
exists a fundamental difference between the decision making
process of humans and ML models So keeping this aspect in
mind adversarial robustness is the measure of ML progress
that is orthogonal to performance2 Common Evaluation Recommendations In this section
we provide a brief discussion on the common evaluation rec
ommendations and we refer interested readers to the recent
article of Carlini et al andbotha UsetargeteduntargetedattacksAdversarial robustness should be evaluated on both targeted
and untargeted attacks In any case it is important to explic
itly state which attack were considered while evaluatingTheoretically an untargeted attack is considered to be strictly
easier than a targeted attack but practically performing an
untargeted attack can give better results than targeting any
of N  1 classes Many untargeted attacks mainly work by
minimizing the prediction condence of the correct
labeContrarily targeted attacks work by maximizing the prediction
condence of some other classb Perform ablation Perform ablation analysis by
removing a combination of defense components and verifying
that the attack succeeds on a similar but undefended modeThis is useful to develop a straight forward understanding
of the goals of the evaluation and assess the effectiveness
of combining multiple defense strategies for robustifying the
modec Diverse test settings Perform the evaluation in diverse
settings ie test the robustness to random noise validate
broader threat models and carefully evaluate the attack hyper
parameters and select those that provide the best performanceIt is also important to verify that the attack converges under
investigate whether attack
selected hyperparameters Also6 are sensitive to a specic set of hyperparameters In
addition experiment witg at least one hard label attack and
one gradient free attackd Evaluate defense on broader domains For a defense
to be truly effective consider evaluating the proposed defense
method on broader domains other than images For instance
the majority of works on adversarial machine learning mainly
investigate the imaging domain State explicitly if the defense
is only capable of defending adversarial perturbations in a
specic domain eg imagese Ensemble over randomness It is important to cre
ate adversarial examples by ensembling over the randomness
of those defenses that randomize aspects of DNN inferenceThe introduced randomness enforces stochasticity and stan

dard attacks become hard to be realized Verify that
attack remains successful when randomness is assigned a xed
value Also dene the threat model and the availability of
randomness knowledge to the adversaryf Transferability attack Select a similar substitute
model to the defended model and perform transferability of
the attack Because the adversarial examples are often trans
ferable across different models ie an adversarial sample
constructed for one model often appears adversarial to another
model with identical architecture  This is true regard
less of the fact that the other model is trained on completely
different data distributiong Upper bound of robustness To provide upper bound
on robustness apply adaptive attacks ie give access to a
full defense Apply the strongest attack for a given threat
model and defense being evaluated Also verify that adap
tive attacks perform better than others and evaluate their
the combination of
performance in multiple settings eg
transfer randomnoise and blackbox attacks For instance
Ruan et al evaluated the robustness of DNN and presented an
approximate approach to provide lower and upper bounds on
robustness for L0 norm with provable guarantees F Testing of ML Models and Autonomous Vehicles1 Behavior Testing of Models In a recent study Sun et aproposed four novel testing criteria for verifying structural fea
tures of DNN using MCDC7 coverage criteria  They
validated proposed methods by generating test cases guided
by their proposed coverage criteria using both symbolic and
gradientbased approach and showed that their method was
able to capture undesired behaviors of DNN Similarly a
set of multigranularity testing criteria named DeepGauge is
presented in 7MCDC Modied ConditionDecision Coverage is a method of mea

able behavior of models is presented in  In  the
rst approach utilizing differential fuzzing testing is presented
for exploiting incorrect behavior of DL systems2 Automated Testing of ML Empowered Autonomous
Vehicles An Overview To ensure a completely secure func
tionality of autonomous vehicles in a realworld environment
the development of automated testing tools is required As the
backbone of autonomous vehicles leverage different ML tech
niques for building decision systems at different levels eg
perception decision making and control etc In this section
we provide an overview of various studies performing test of
autonomous vehiclesTian et al A generic framework for testing security and robustness
of ML models for computer vision systems depicting real
istic properties is presented in  Authors evaluated the
security of fteen state of the art computer vision systems
in black box setting including Nvidias Dave selfdriving
system Moreover it has been provably demonstrated that there
exists a tradeoff between adversarial robustness to pertur
bations and the standard accuracy of the model in a fairly
simple and natural setting  A simulationbased frame
work for generating adversariatest cases to evaluate the
closedloop properties of ML enabled autonomous vehicles
is presented in  In  authors generated adversar
ial driving scenes using Bayesian optimization to improve
selfdriving behavior utilizing visionbased imitation learningAn autoencoderbased approach for automatic identication
of unusual events using small dashcam video and the inertiasensor is presented in VI OPEN RESEARCH ISSUESThe advancement of ML research and its state of the art
performance in various complex domains in particular the
advent of more sophisticated DL methods might be an inherent
panacea to the conventional challenges of vehicular networksHowever MLDL methods cannot be naively applied to vehic
ular networks that possess unique characteristics and adaption
of these methods for learning such distinguishing features of
vehicular networks is a challenging task  In this section
we highlight a few promising areas of research that require
further investigationA Efcient Distributed Data StorageIn the connected vehicular ecosystem the data is generated
and stored in a distributed fashion that raises a question about
the applicability of MLDL models at a global level As Mmodels are developed with the assumption that data is easily
accessible and managed by a central entity there is a need to
utilize distributed learning methods for connected vehicles so
that data may be scalably acquired from multiple units in the
ecosystemB Interpretable MAnother major security vulnerability in CAVs is the lack
of interpretability of ML schemes ML techniques in generaand DL techniques specically are based on the idea of func
tion approximation where the approximation of the empiricafunction is performed using DNN architectures Current works
in MLDL lack interpretability which is resulting in a major
hurdle in the progress of MLDL empowered CAVs The lack
of interpretability is exploited by the adversaries to construct
adversarial examples for fooling the deployed MLDL schemes
in autonomous vehicles ie physical attacks on selfdriving
vehicles as discussed above Development of secure explain
able and interpretable ML techniques for securitycriticaapplications of CAVs is another open research issueC Defensive and Secure MDespite many defense proposals presented in the literature
for adversarial attacks developing adversarially robust Mmodels remains yet another open research problem Almost
every defense has been shown to be only effective for a
specic attack type and fails for stronger or unseen attacksMoreover most defenses address the problem of adversar
ial attacks for computer vision tasks but adversarial ML is
being developed for many other vertical application domainsTherefore development of efcient and effective novel defense
strategies is essentially required particularly for safetycriticaapplications eg communication between connected vehiclesD Privacy Preserving MPreserving privacy in any usercentric application is of high
concern Privacy means that models should not reveal any
additionathe subjects involved in col
lected training data aka differential privacy  As CAVs
involve human subjects ML model learning should be capableinformation about  Restrictions applyIEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS  TUTORIALS VOL 22 NO 2 SECOND QUARTERof preserving the privacy of drivers passengers and pedestri
ans where privacy breaches can results in extremely harmfconsequencesE Security Centric Proxy MetricsDevelopment of securitycentric proxy metrics to evaluate
security threats against systems is fundamentally importantCurrently there is no way to formalize different types of
perturbation properties eg
indistinguishable and content
preserving etc In addition there is no function to determine
that a specic transformation is contentpreserving Similarly
the process of measuring perceptual similarity between two
images is very complex and widely used perceptual metrics
are shallow functions that fail to account for many subtle
distinctions of human perception F Fair and Accountable MThe literature on ML reveals that MLbased results and
predictions lack fairness and accountability The fairness prop
erty ensures that the ML model did not nurture discrimination
against specic cases eg favoring cyclists over pedestriansThis bias in ML predictions is introduced by the biased train
ing data and results in social bias and higher error rate for a
particular demographic group For example researchers iden
tied a risk of bias in the perception system of autonomous
vehicles to recognize pedestrians with dark skin  This
is an experimental work in which authors evaluated dif
ferent models developed by other academic researchers for
autonomous vehicles Despite the fact that this work does not
use an actual object detection model that is being used by
autonomous vehicles in the market nor did it use the train
ing data being used by autonomous vehicle manufactures this
study highlights a major vulnerability of ML models used in
autonomous vehicles and raises serious concerns about their
applicability in realworld settings where a selfdriving vehi
cle may encounter people from a variety of demographic
backgroundsThe accountability of ML models is associated with their
interpretability property as we are interested in developing
such models that can explain their predictions using the
models internal parameters The notion of accountability is
fundamentally important to understand ML model failures for
adversarial examplesG Robustifying ML Models Against Distribution DriftsTo restrict the integrity attacks ML models should be made
robust against distribution drifts which refer to the situation
where train and test data distributions are different This dif
ference between the training and test distributions gives rise
to adversarial examples These examples can also be consid
ered as the worst case distribution drifts  It is fairly
clear that the data collection process in the vehicular ecosys
tem is temporal and dynamic in nature so such distribution
drifts are highly possible and will affect the robustness of
the underlying ML systems Moreover such drifts can be
exploited by the adversaries to create adversarial samples dur
ing inference for example in distribution drift by introducing positively connotated words
in spam emails to evade detection Moreover modication of
the training distribution is also possible in a similar way and
distribution drift violates the widely known presumption that
we can achieve low learning error when a large training data is
available Ford et al VII CONCLUSIONThe recent discoveries that machine learning ML tech
niques are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations have raised
questions on the security of connected and autonomous vehi
cles CAVs which utilize ML techniques for various tasks
ranging from environmental perception to objection recogni
tion and movement prediction The safetycritical nature of
CAVs clearly demands that the technology it uses should be
robust to all kinds of potential security threatsbe they acci
dental intentional or adversarial In this work we present
for the rst time a comprehensive analysis of the challenges
posed by adversarial ML attacks for CAVs aggregating insights
from both the ML and CAV literature Our major contribu
tions include a broad description of the ML pipeline used
in CAVs description of the various adversarial attacks that
can be launched on the various components of the CAV Mpipeline a detailed taxonomy of the adversarial ML threat for
CAVs a comprehensive survey of adversarial ML attacks and
defenses proposed in literature Finally open research chal
lenges and future directions are discussed to provide readers
with the opportunity to develop robust and efcient solutions

seecsedupkDigital Object Identier 101109RBME1It is anticipated that the world will have a shortage of 129 million healthcareworkers by 2035 of datadriven patientcentred clinical methods due to which
people are being assessed on population averages  To address
these challenges technologybased health can be utilised to
provide support to the healthcare system Especially speech
processing has great potential to provide innovative solutions
in healthcare to facilitate both patients and doctorsBroadly speaking human speech is the most natural mode of
human communication It provides information about linguis
tic content and paralinguistic states and traits The linguistic
content represents the intended message that the speaker wishes
to convey or communicate Paralinguistics content of speech
provides a much rich array of information related to speakers
identity gender and age Research efforts are exploring the
intelligent modelling of speech signals for various important
applications Speech processing research is currently gaining
interest to utilise computational paralinguistic analysis for the
assessment of different health conditions The prime reason
to use speech for healthcare is that it can be easily available
collected transmitted and stored  Most importantly various
physical and mental diseases cause changes in human speech
which are measurable with the help of speech technologySpeech technology involving the processing and analysis
of human speech is a major area of research these daysIt encompasses various areas of research such as automatic
speech recognition ASR speaker recognitionverication text
to speech TTS conversion and identication of language age
and gender using speech Research on speech technology has
endeavoured to empower machines to involve in verbal human
machine interactions HCI These days speech technology
based interfaces have become widely adopted worldwide in
various routinelyused devices and applications with services
such as Apples Siri and Google Voice Search used by millions
of users  Researchers are now aiming to transform the
current verbal HCI interfaces into the next generation medicacompanions that react with humans more naturally and monitor
users mental and physical health at their home work hospitaor anywhere In all these areas deep learning DL is emerging
as an essential component of stateoftheart approachesRecent progress in speech processing along with other ad

ML algorithms developmentA PreProcessingPreprocessing of speech signals is considered as an important
step in designing robust and efcient systems for various appli
cations It usually involves noise suppression silence removal
and channel equalisation etc The performance of speechbased
systems can be improved with the use of these preprocessing
techniques   It has been also validated that removing
silence pauses and noise even helps MLDL models in achieving
better performance  In the case of speech synthesis text
processing is even more complex it involves text normalisa
tion tokenisation sentence segmentation etc  It is equally
important in speech synthesis to improve system performanceB Feature ExtractionThe representation of speech signals into meaningful in
formative and a reasonably limited number of features is a
crucial component for developing any system for speechbased
applications Despite the fact that there is no unique taxonomy of
speech features it is common to divide features into two types
ie linguistic and acoustic features The extraction procedures
for these two types of features are signicantly different and
their performance greatly depends upon the type of problem at
handLinguistic features represent information in spoken wordsThis usually includes specic words their grammatical alter
ations or higher semantic and pragmatic markers  A variety
of techniques exists for the analysis of speech using linguistic
features For example keyword spotting aims at the reliable
detection of a particular word in a given speech   These
words are chosen from daily life and considered sufcient to
represent the speakers states and related eventsAcoustic features are very popular and widely being usedThese features are primarily extracted using the models of the
human auditory system Human hearingrelated properties such
as lower sensitivity at lower frequencies spectral amplitude
compression nonlinear frequency scale and large spectral inte
gration are also considered in acoustic features Ongoing research on speech analysis has categorised the
acoustic features into three categories prosodic spectral and
temporal and features related to the voice quality  Prosody refers to melody and rhythm of speech and prosodic
features include the feature related to the length tone accent
stress intonation and few others   These features can
be used to detect the irregularities in the rhythm and timing
of speech For instance nonverbal speech cues such as inter
ruptions natural turns counting the number of interjectionsFig 1 Organisation of papersystems It will create huge opportunities for speech technology
to be utilised for remote diagnostics and monitoring chronic
disease management and independent care for the elderly and
much more This paper aims to cover the stateoftheart speech
technology and its applications in the eld of healthcareThe main contribution of this paper is to highlight the
substantial potential of speech technology for improving the
stateoftheart in healthcare To the best of our knowledge this
is the rst comprehensive paper that reviews the stateofthe
art research from the different speechrelated eldsincluding
automatic speech recognition ASR speech synthesis or text

tential for healthcare This work builds upon previous papers
with a limited focus that aimed to demonstrate the potential of
speech recognition for healthcare The organisation of the paper see Fig 1 is described nextIn section II a brief premier on speech technology is presented
followed by a discussion of the potential opportunities of speech
technology in healthcare in section III Next we cover the
stateoftheart works on speech technology for healthcare and
some of its prominent healthcare solutions which is followed by
challenges that are causing hurdles for speech technology to be
utilised in healthcare in section V Before concluding the paper
we discuss important open issues and future direction that can
help researchers to make the use of speech technology more
effective in section VII PRIMER ON SPEECH TECHNOLOGYSpeech technology aims to enable machines to recognise
analyse and understand human speech The area has been
developing for decades as a subeld of signal processing and
has seen much progress in the last decade or so due to the huge
progress made under deep learning paradigms Typically speech
technology systems include three major components as shown  Restrictions applyIEEE REVIEWS IN BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING VOL 14TABLESUMMARY OF SOME POPULAR DL MODELSand response times can help to identify irregular speech pat
terns  In contrast to temporal features spectral features are
computed by converting the speech signal into the frequency
domain Most popular temporal and spectral features include
energy  entropy  zerocrossing rate ZCR  spec
tral centroid spectral rolloff and spectral ux  Similarly
voice qualityrelated features include jitter shimmer unvoiced
rate and harmonictonoise ratio HNR etcRecently the speech community also started using raw speech
instead of handengineered features For these features they
use DL models to extract datadriven features related to the
task at hand Such features have shown promising results for
different speechrelated tasks including ASR  emotion de
tection  and speaker identication  However the per
formance of such methods needs to be explored and compared
with various handengineered features for healthrelated tasksC Deep LearningIn speech technology the hidden Markov model HMM and
Gaussian mixture model GMM based models GMMHMMhave ruled for decades A disruptive breakthrough happened in
speech technology in the last decade due to DL and now Dmodels have become an essential component of ASR TTS and
other speech processing and analysis tasks This section is aimed
to present an introductory and higherlevel overview of DL For
an indepth description the interested readers are referred to
classical resources  However we presented the summary
of different DL architecture in Table I DL is distinguished from
legacy articial neural networks ANNs in terms of having
two or more layers between input and output layers The basic
component of a deep neural network DNN is the neuron unitThe neurons in each layer are fully connected with the neurons
of the adjacent layers to create a network The input signal is
passed through the network with intermediate computation and
approximate function y  f x  by learning the best value
of the parameters  A multilayer network or DNN creates a
pipeline of nonlinear transformations with the ability to learn
intermediate representations suitable for a given task at handIn 2006 an idea of the learning hierarchy of feature rep
resentations in different layers of the deep learning models
was initiated by Hinton considered for speech modelling  More recently research
in speech technology has been focused on endtoend learning
paradigms from raw speech using convolutional neural networks
CNNs They can learn lterbank from raw speech and able to
capture more generalised discriminative and contextual repre
sentation from raw waveform Convolutional neural networks CNNs were originated
from image processing for processing data in gridlike topologyThey are also extended for natural language processing NLPand speech processing The building block of CNNs is a con
volutional layer that consists of multiple lters and it computes
local feature maps from the input The convolutional operation
in CNNs can be dened ashkij  Wk  q  bkwhere hkij is the i jth element for the kth output feature
map q represents the input feature maps and Wk and bk denote
the kth lter and bias respectively The symbol  represents
the 2D convolution operation The second component of CNNs
is the pooling layer to facilitates nonlinear subsampling oper
ations is to reduce the dimension of each feature maps while
retaining the most important features Finally fully connected
layers are used to achieve the required prediction for regression
or classication tasks In speech processing it is very common to
use CNN in conjunction with recurrent neural networks RNNsRecurrent neural networks RNNs dene a special Darchitecture that uses recurrent connections within layers with
the capability of processing previously processed inputs In con

representational memoryht  HWxhxt  Whhht1  bhyt  Wxhxt  bywhere W terms denote the weight matrices b represents bias

specialised RNN architectures were proposed These include

APPLICATIONSThe current healthcare system is struggling to provide quality
health services at an affordable price The effectiveness of health
services can be signicantly enhanced by using the opportunitiesoffered by speech technology  Such opportunities are high
lighted in Fig 4 and this section provide a detailed discussion
on these opportunitiesA Fixing Speech and Hearing ImpairmentsHumans express their feelings thoughts and ideas by speak
ing Speech is produced by the action of coordinated muscles
in the head neck chest and abdomen The development of
speech is a gradual process that involves years of practiceDuring this process a human child learns how to regulate these
muscles to produce understandable speech Individuals that are
unable to properly regulate these muscles face speech disordersDisorders related to voice and language also affect human com
munication  Hearing problems are also a cause of imperfect
communications among humans Individuals who do not hear
someone with normal hearing thresholds of 25 dB or better in
both ears face hearing impairments According to the world
health organisation WHO over 5 of the worlds population
466 million people has hearing loss and it is expected that this
number will increase up to 900 million people by 2050 Speech technology can be utilised to assist individuals with
a hearing problem or a voice speech or language disorder to
communicate effectively  ASR plays an important role in
the applications of speech therapy which require to decode the
user utterances  Similarly speech synthesis provides can
teach users how a word or sentence should be pronounced which
reinforcing the correct pronunciation in the speech therapy ac
tivities In this way systems based on speech synthesis and ASR
can be used to augment the quality of human communication in
healthcare   Such assisting systems aim at improving
the intelligibility of pathologic speech by producing speech
similar to the voice of the speaker  Speech technology
can also be used for design interfaces for childrens speech

ders B Speech Interfaces for Doctors and PatientsSpeech interface describes an automated software that uses
either simulated human speech or human speech to interact
with humans They provide services in handsfree eyesfree
and keyboardfree situations With 50 of a healthcare profes
sionals time is spent on clinical documentation overwhelmed
clinicians often spend more time on clinical documentation
compared to direct patient care a fact that can drain and de
motivate clinicians Speech interfaces can provide a convenient
integration in healthcare to reduce the burden of medical doctorsThe implementation of such interfaces can bring a lot of benets
to the healthcare industry from timesaving to costreducingFirst of all practitioners and nurses will be able to become
more efcient in the process of transcripts  Secondly it wiincrease productivity in healthcare systems  Another benet
is that it will also reduce the amount of time by a doctor to see
the patients by using readily available information Similarly
speech technology is a major mean of reducing the cost of
traditional medical transcription in healthcare systems More
than 30 of institutions were able to save more than 1 million
over the period of two or more years  Voicebased assistants
can maintain patients electronic medical records EMR and
provide relevant information when needed In a recent con
trolled observational study  participants found that speech
recognition in clinical documentation can saves time increases
efciency and allows to make more detailed notes with relevant
details Speech technologybased interfaces can help the patients
during their hospital stay and after discharge In particular
speech interfaces can facilitate patients recovering at home
especially when they have restricted mobility through support
for environment control such as adjusting a rooms temperature
controlling audio levels requesting nursing assistance and in
decision support  symptoms or patterns which impact multiple areas of lifeHumans feel a vast range of comfortable and uncomfortable
emotions Recent studies have shown the promise of using speech as an
effective biomarker for the diagnosis of psychological disordersSpoken speech can provide a wide range of acoustic features that
can be effectively utilised for human emotion detection  D Home and Elder CareC Speech Processing for Psychological DisordersThe term psychological disorder which refers to psychiatric
disorders or mental disorders are behavioural or psychologicaLife expectancy is greatly increasing worldwide which is
causing a higher number of older people in our society The increased share of the elderly population is shifting the
cause of death from parasitic and infectious diseases to chronic  Restrictions apply TABLECOMPARISON OF RECENT STUDIES ON ASRillnesses   Ageing also causes physical limitations that
need to be compensated by the assistance of someone or with the
services of aged care centres Elderly people feel isolation fear
and a sense of helplessness both inhome and at oldage care
centres which cause severe consequences on both physical and
mental health Speechbased assistants are a valuable tool for
seniors staying at home or age care centres especially for those
who are not able to use other technologybased services that may
require the dexterity of the hands mobility andor good visionSuch systems can also provide them with independence and a
better quality of life with physical or cognitive disease E Access to Healthcare Services Particularly in
Developing CountriesMillions of people in developing countries unnecessarily suf
fer and eventually die from such illnesses that have effective cure
and prevention  Generally people in developing countries
have poor literacy skills ie reading writing It has been shown
that people with low health literacy have a oneinthree chance
of misunderstanding the prescribed medication  There is
a direct correlation between mortality rates and poor health
literacy approximately 50 to 80 increased mortality risk for
individuals with poor health literacy  Language diversity
is another challenge in developing countries that reduces the
potential benets of healthcare services such as text messaging
and ehealth portals  Such healthcare services are also not
much useful for lowliterates the blind the visually impaired
and those that are not computer literate Speech is a plausi
ble interaction modality for illiterate users and speechbased
healthcare services can be ideal for inhabitants of the developing
countriesIV SPEECH FOR HEALTHCARE STATEOFTHEARTA Automatic SpeechRecognition ASRAutomatic speech recognition ASR is the analogue of
machine ear which enables a computer to recognise uttered
speech and transform it into the corresponding sequence of
words or subwords ASR has witnessed a steady improvement
in performance due to the development of cuttingedge Malgorithms Traditionally HMM and GMM based models were
the main stock of research for ASR DNNbased ASR systems
have become the stateoftheart by showing huge improvements
compared to previous conventional system  Developing and
training ASR systems however is complicated and requires
a lot of preprocessing Various attempts have been made toreduce the complexity of ASR paving the way for endtoend
speech recognition  Nowadays endtoend ASR systems
are extensively used and studied for ASR in different languages
such as English Mandarin Japanese or French  Similarly
sequencetosequence models are also gaining popularity in
the automatic speech recognition ASR community  Vari
ous sequencetosequence models including Recurrent NeuraNetwork Transducer RNNT  Neural Transducer 
Listen Attend and Spell LAS  Recurrent Neural Aligner
RNA  and Monotonic Alignments A major application of ASR in healthcare is to facilitate
the generation of clinical documentations  The medicaerrors caused by bad handwriting can be avoided using speech
recognition for medical documentations  Such selftyping
systems are also believed to enhance documentation quality and
efciency as well as improve the satisfaction level of health
professionals in clinics or hospitals Different research studies explored the feasibility of ASR sys
tems for clinical documentation For instance in The efciency of speech recognition is evaluated by Hoyt
et al   Restrictions applyIEEE REVIEWS IN BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING VOL 14documentation is more convenient accurate and expeditious
for instance speech recognition helped in improving note qual
ity and allowed for closing a patient encounter on the same
day Similarly authors in All of these studies highlight several benets of using ASR
for clinical documentation However most of these studies are
pilot projects Although the use of ASR can drive interactive
clinical documentation however careful evaluation is required
for EHR  There is still a need to improve the efciency
of ASR for medical documentation to avoid errors that have the
potential to cause clinical harms Furthermore improved system
interoperability and workow are needed for their successfintegration in the clinical setting B Speech BiomarkersHuman voice incorporates features that can plausibly be
used to discriminate on the basis of gender age intelligence
socioeconomic status regionalethnic origin education and
occupation  Most importantly for health outcomes it
provides information about various voice disorders which can
be diagnosed by detecting anomalous voice quality pitch and
loudness that is inappropriate for an individuals age gender
cultural background or geographic location  Other speech
related disorders include cognitivecommunication disorders
communication disorders swallowing disorders and an autism
spectrum disorder Speech technologybased solutions have
been playing an important role in the diagnostic and monitoring
of these disorders Nowadays DL models have become the
stateoftheart technique in this domainAutomatic detection of vocal fold pathologies is of great
interest to the voice community as well as the medical commu
nity due to its low cost and noninvasive nature These systems
can be used by clinicians to detect the existence of any voice
pathologies even in the early stages Fang et al systems for smart cities but their work used classical ML models
in their architecturesAcoustic analysis of speech is also used for the diagnosis
of Alzheimers disease which is cognitive impairment and the
most common cause of dementia It has a high prevalence that
is increasing rapidly towards an epidemic level The research
community is trying to utilise speech technology to solve this
issue In  LopezdeIpina et al proposed a nonlinear
multitask approach using a multilayer perceptron MLP and
CNNs for Alzheimers detection The authors evaluated the
proposed models using different speech features and reported
promising results In  Fraser et al explored the use of
linguistic features for the identication of Alzheimers They
achieved stateoftheart results and found that linguistic analy
sis using modern ML is increasingly useful in assessment and
clustering of AlzheimersSpeech analysis is also being utilised for Parkinsons disease
PD detection For instance authors in Human speech provides a wide range of prosodic and spectrafeatures that can be effectively utilised for emotion recognition
depression distress anxiety and stress detection Acoustic fea
tures including spectral prosodic cepstral glottal and Teager
energy operators TEO were evaluated in for clinical depres
sion detection in adolescents  Authors found that TEO
based features produced more promising results compared to
all other features In  the authors showed that the prosody
and voice qualityrelated speech features can be used for the
identication of suicidal and nonsuicidal adolescents In 
behaviour prediction of canceraficted patients is performed
using different speech features They showed that speech can
effectively be utilised for behavioural prediction in cancer pa
tients Various other studies Most of the abovementioned studies have used publicly
available datasets and showed that speech technology can be
effectively utilised as biomarkers for the detection of various
diseases However these systems have not been evaluated in
reallife settings It is important for researchers to focus on the
design of systems that can be utilised in clinics and medicahospitals and on reporting reallife performance evaluationsC Remote MonitoringThe rising burden on the global healthcare system along
with the limited availability of trained healthcare profession
als is increasing the demand for infrastructure and technology
that can facilitate the remote monitoring of patients Speech  Restrictions apply technologybased remote monitoring services have been ex
plored in this regard by the research community In 
Hossain used speech along with and facial expressions which
are captured in a multisensory environment The author tested
the proposed framework on 100 people and was able to detect
the patients state with an average recognition of 982 In
another work Vatanparvar et al Various studies also have proposed speech remote monitoring
systems by exploiting the advanced communication technolo
gies A 5G enabled emotionaware healthcare framework was
proposed in  The authors evaluated the proposed health
care framework on 50 universitylevel students who were asked
to express the emotion of pain They used both speech and video
as the input of the system and achieved 9995 of accuracyA privacyenhanced emotion recognition system for remote
advisory is presented in  the authors showed that the pro
posed system can solve privacy issues while achieving promis
ing results Similarly an edgecloud based privacypreserving
automatic emotion recognition system is proposed which use
both speech and visual features  They used CNNs for
emotion classication and achieved improved results compared
to the stateoftheart systems Some other studies D Speech SynthesisSpeech synthesis also known as texttospeech TTS is an
important technology that aims to convert text into speechMost of the TTS systems use acoustic or linguistic features
as an intermediate representation to generate the waveformTraditionally the speech waveform was vocoded from these in
termediate representation using heuristic methods TABLEMEAN OPINION SCORE MOS EVALUATIONS COMPARISON FOR
VARIOUS SYSTEMSspeech Researchers are also focusing on synthesising more
natural speech by transferring prosody  style  and
expressions  All these studies have highlighted the great
progress made by TTS systems that shows their suitability in
healthcare We also compared the performance in terms of mean
opinion score MOS of different stateoftheart TTS systems
in Table III which depicts that these systems are achieving MOS
almost similar to the ground truth speechTexttospeech TTS solutions can assist healthcares mis
sion of bettering patient care through the use of assistive and
digital tools It can further enhance digital health technology by
speechbased health apps websites and emergency call systems
etc Patients can be verbally reminded about important alerts
using TTS which increases the usability and accessibility of
portable health trackers  Different studies evaluated the
feasibility of TTS assistive healthcare system For instance
Liu et al TTS health assistive tools can dramatically improve people
health and required costs For example a TTSbased system can
facilitate patients by offering them an audio version of digitatext   This is especially helpful for illiterate individ
uals language learners and the elderly population and people
with learning disabilities or reduced vision Such systems can
also help people by providing an audio version of important med
ical information such as descriptions of diseases prescriptions
and drug information leaets This avoids drug misuse while
making patients cautious about their health  TTSbased
systems also allow patients to accurately communicate their
needs which helps to establish a cognitive connection among
doctors and patients E Some Healthcare Solution Using Speech TechnologyAs outlined above speech technology nds its market in
healthcare particularly due to potential and impactful use casesVarious voiceenabled healthcare solutions are developed that
can help improve the lives of thousands of individuals We
presented the details of some prominent solutions in Table IV  Restrictions applyIEEE REVIEWS IN BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING VOL 14TABLE IV
SOME PROMINENT SPEECH TECHNOLOGY BASED HEALTHCARE SOLUTIONSFig 5 Challenges of deep learning DL empowered speech processing in healthcareThese solutions are being used by both doctors and patients to
change the traditional setting of health provision The devel
opment of speechbased solutions is continuously growing that
will signicantly impact the current healthcare system in the
next several yearsV SPEECH FOR HEALTHCARE CHALLENGESDespite the promising potentials of speech technology in the
health domain there are various hurdles in largescale deploy
ment of speechenabled solutions In this section we discuss
these challenges that need to be addressed to make the rapid
adoption of speech technology in healthcare a taxonomy is
depicted in FigA Speech Based Adversarial AttacksEven though modern DLbased speech solutions offer great
benets to the current healthcare system there are still questions
about the security of the underlying DL algorithms as recent
works have shown that DL models are prone to adversariaattacks Adversarial attacks are launched by creating adversar
ial examples in which nonrandom imperceptible perturbations
are added to input samples through optimization algorithms that
aim to fool the classier and inuence it to make incorrect
decisions These attacks are powerful enough to signicantly
bring down the performance of the stateoftheart DNN based
systems  A popular method for generating such adversariaattacks is to generate the perturbation by utilizing gradient
based methodsmany popular attacks such as fast gradient
sign method FGSM  Jacobianbased saliency map at
tack JSMA  DeepFool  and Carlini and Wagner
attacks Researchers have also proposed various adversarial attacks
against speechbased systems For example Carlini and Wag
ner   Restrictions apply technology to for healthcare Therefore it is necessary to design
such systems that preserve patients privacy in the healthcare
settingsB Scarcity of Speech DataTo achieve generalisation in DL models a large amount of
data is essential In the case of speech processing and analysis
the available datasets are typically very limited  Even for
a very developed eld of ASR we have transcribed datasets
for very few languages compared to the number of spoken lan
guages worldwide There are more than 5 000 spoken languages
globally however only 389 languages are spoken by 94 of
the worlds population2 In speech processing we do not even
have speech datasets for 389 languages   Therefore
research in language and speech analysis research is facing
the problem of data scarcity  This imbalance variation
diversity and dynamics in speech and languages cause hurdles
in designing speechbased healthcare systems For example the
performance of ASR systems degrades when they are evaluated
across different languages  Therefore we need to design
more adaptive healthcare solutions using ASR trained on multi
ple languages data The datasets related to speech disorders are
also very few and have very small sizes   To solve this
issue techniques such as transfer learning selftaught learning
etc can be utilised to improve the generalisability of the modelsC Interoperability ChallengesIn current healthcare systems the data generated from differ
ent medical devices clinical reports medical correspondence
electronic health records EHRs These medical data are typ
ically fragmented or isolated within hospitals and laborato
ries The interoperability of these medical records is prohibited
among different health services providers  On the contrary
different EHRs medical devices and other IT systems are also
not interoperable if data sharing is allowed among different hos
pitals  For the effective utilisation of speech in healthcare
we need to enable interoperability in current healthcare sys
tems This would boost the speed of diagnostic procedures and
provide a complete history of patients to medical practitionersTherefore the attention of researchers and other stakeholders
working in the healthcare sector is required to nd solutions for
interoperability challengesD Cultural and Language BarriersCultural and language diversity reduces the potential use of
speech technology in digital healthcare Digital health is not only
a technological but cultural transformation Cultural barrier is a
major challenge for digital transformation which becomes more
prevalent in rural and developing areas The transformation of
people from the classical method to digital health is slowed down
by ignoring the importance of cultural changes and the human
factors  Therefore it is important to consider culturabarriers while designing healthcare solutions In addition to
cultural barriers language diversity problem is another major2Online Available  It is found that the linguistic differences among patients
and medical doctors can cause patients to misinterpret med
ications and suffer unnecessary complications  Therefore
healthcare solutions based speech technology must be trained on
multiple languages to work effectively in such situations How
ever the development of speech technologybased healthcare
systems becomes more challenging for rarely spoken languagesTherefore it is very important to consider language diversity
while designing speechbased healthcare solutionsVI OPEN ISSUES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONSSpeech technology is expected to drive the change in the
healthcare system by changing the conventional ways of medicatreatments However there are some open issues that require
serious attention and consideration of the researchers There
fore in this section we highlighted such open issues and with
important pointers and future research directions for the research
communityA Privacy and Ethical ConcernsWhen people use speechbased services such as speech recog
nition or voice authentication they provide complete possession
to their voice recordings to the respective device or software In
these services speech can be used by an adversary or attacker
to extract users information such as speakers identity gender
ethnicity information and emotional state The adversary can
use this information for undesired purposes such as to foovoiceauthentication systems Similarly users speech can also
be edited or used to create a fake speech that the person never
spoke Several other privacyrelated concerns arise while using
speech technologybased services  In healthcare systems
information is more personal and very sensitive and people
are more vulnerable to the misuse of their data Therefore
it is important to utilise speech processing in healthcare by
considering both privacy and ethical concerns In this regard
privacypreserving DL algorithms can be utilised to protect
speaker identity   gender identity  Similarly
federated learning B Adoptability and Affordability IssuesSpeechbased digital healthcare solutions are intended to be
used by all types of users including people with no literacy or
education about smart devices Usability of healthcare solutions
effects adoption of various innovative digital healthcare products
or services  Therefore it is crucial for developers to consider
these issues while designing HCI interface for speech based
healthcare solutions It is also important to provide speech
technologybased services at an affordable cost as it directly
impacts on the adaptability of these solutions C IoT Based SolutionsThe paradigm of Internet of Things IoT offers unprece
dented opportunities for digital healthcare solutions by provid
ing an abstraction of innite physical smart and virtual objects  Restrictions applyIEEE REVIEWS IN BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING VOL 14These objects can capture store and securely transmit health
related information to a public or private cloud and facilitate
a new level of automation for the convenience of users Most
importantly IoTbased solutions are very effective in terms
of energy consumption CPU and memory usage  It is
anticipated that IoT will disrupt the current healthcare systems
by providing various cuttingedge and highly individualised
digital healthcare solutions  These solutions can be utilised
for remote monitoring and diagnostics chronic diseases man
agement elderly care and much more Therefore it is very
important to utilise the opportunities offered by IoT to enhance
the effectiveness of speechbased healthcare servicesD Potentials With 5GHealthcare expenditure takes a big portion of the nationabudgets of various countries For instance roughly 18 of
North Americas and 10 of the global economys gross do
mestic product GDP account for healthcare spending Technologyenabled healthcare solutions can provide health
services outside the hospital setting at remote locations which
can promote adherence to medications and reduce cost and
readmission rates  Telehealth services by utilising 4G LTE
have shown sound economic benets  which will be
further fuelled by the increasing amount of smartphones and
expeditiously improving connectivity with 5G network It is
anticipated that 5G will provide a consistent user experience not
only in dense areas but also in remote locations This will pave
the path for telehealth services available everywhere Therefore
it is important for researchers working on speech processing for
health to consider the opportunities offered by communication
technologies while designing healthcare solutionsE Sustainability IssuesSpeech technologybased healthcare solutions have great po
tentials in healthcare and they are getting great interest and
attention among industries and healthcare service providersHowever it is important to understand how any particular speech
technologybased healthcare solution can attain a certain leveof adoption to achieve scale The sustainability of any new
digital health solutions is always considered uncertain as they
involve different various public and private stakeholders The sustainability of such projects and products become more
uncertain in developing countries where people avoid to use
digital technology Therefore a proper collaboration is always
needed among stakeholders to support the project to make a
transition from pilot stage to a selfsustainable longterm projectVII CONCLUSIONSpeech technology has unprecedented opportunities for the
health domain and these potential opportunities can be reaped
to x the current healthcare system that is continuously facing an
increasing burden of the ageing population and chronic diseasesIn this paper we highlighted the potentials of speech technology
for healthcare and presented a stateoftheart work on health
care from different speechrelated including automatic speech
recognition ASR speech synthesis and speech processingfor different speechrelated disorders The reviewed literature
showed that the research on speech processing for healthcare is
rapidly evolving with very promising results However these
results are mainly from some pilot projects or using some
publicly available datasets and the available healthcare solutions
based on speech technology are being used on a very smascale There are various factors hindering the growth of speech
technology in healthcare that we discussed in detail in this paperMost importantly we presented open issues and based on that
we outlined future strategies for making speech technologies
even more effective in healthcare which include the utilisation
of other emerging technologies like internet of things IoT and
communication technologies like 5G

sarial  ML  attacks  can  be  categorized  into  twotypes In a whitebox attack it is assumed thatthe adversary has perfect knowledge of the Marchitecture trainingtesting data and the hyper
parameters of the model In contrast in a black
box  attack  it  is  considered  that  the  adversaryhas partial access or no access to the deployedmodel Based on the knowledgeaccess of theadversary blackbox attacks are further dividedinto two categories namely querybased attacksand zeroquery attacks A blackbox attack wherean  adversary  can  act  as  a  standard  user  andquery the ML model for a response and later usethat queryresponse pair to generate an adver
sarial example is known as a querybased attackThe zeroquery attack is defined as a blackboxattack where the adversary has no access to thedeployed ML model but has only a few test sam
ples available to craft adversarial examples againsta deployed ML modeBased on the adversarial intent speci city wecan further divide evasion attacks into two classesIn a targeted attack the attacker aims to fool theML classifi er to classify all adversarial samples inone class by maximizing the probability of thetargeted attack For example an adversary thatwants to disguise the intrusive traffic as normanetwork traffi  c can create a perturbation that max
imizes the classifi cation probability of the normatraffic class In a nontargeted attack the attack
er aims to fool the ML classifier by assigning anadversarial sample to any other class except theoriginal one These attacks are performed by min
imizing the probability of the original class thatensures that the adversarial sample will not getclassifi ed in the original classAll classifi cation schemes depicted in the tax
onomy are directly related to the intentgoal ofthe  adversary  Most  of  the  existing  adversariaML attacks are whitebox attacks which are laterconverted to blackbox attacks by exploiting thetransferability property of adversarial examples The transferability property of adversarial Mmeans that adversarial perturbations generatedfor one ML model will often mislead other unseenML models Related research has been carriedout on adversarial pattern recognition for morethan a decade and even before that there was asmattering of works focused on performing ML inthe presence of malicious errors brIef revIew of the AdversArIAl Ml lIterAture

research the bulk of such works has focused on supervised learning Recently there has been a rising
trend of employing unsupervised machine learning using unstructured raw network data to improve network
performance and provide services such as trafc engineering anomaly detection Internet trafc classica
tion and quality of service optimization The growing interest in applying unsupervised learning techniques
in networking stems from their great success in other elds such as computer vision natural language
processing speech recognition and optimal control eg for developing autonomous selfdriving carsIn addition unsupervised learning can unconstrain us from the need for labeled data and manual handcrafted
feature engineering thereby facilitating exible general and automated methods of machine learning The
focus of this survey paper is to provide an overview of applications of unsupervised learning in the domain of
networking We provide a comprehensive survey highlighting recent advancements in unsupervised learning
techniques and describe their applications in various learning tasks in the context of networking We also
provide a discussion on future directions and open research issues while identifying potential pitfalls While
a few survey papers focusing on applications of machine learning in networking have previously been
published a survey of similar scope and breadth is missing in the literature Through this timely review
we aim to advance the current state of knowledge by carefully synthesizing insights from previous survey

GPU technology and other hardware enhancements It is
anticipated that AI and ML will also make a similar impact
on the networking ecosystem and will help realize a future
vision of cognitive networks   in which networks wiselforganize and will autonomously implement intelligent
networkwide behavior to solve problems such as routing
scheduling resource allocation and anomaly detection The
initial attempts towards creating cognitive or intelligent
networks have relied mostly on supervised ML methods
which are efcient and powerful but are limited in scope
by their need for labeled data With network data becom
ing increasingly voluminous with a disproportionate rise
in unstructured unlabeled data there is a groundswell of
interest in leveraging unsupervised ML methods to utilize
unlabeled data in addition to labeled data where available
to optimize network performance  The rising interest in
applying unsupervised ML in networking applications also
stems from the need to liberate ML applications from restric
tive demands of supervised ML Another reason of employing
unsupervised ML in networking is the expensiveness of
curating labeled network data at scale since labeled data
may be unavailable and manual annotation is prohibitively
inconvenient in addition to be outdated quickly due to the
highly dynamic nature of computer networks We are already witnessing the failure of human network
administrators to manage and monitor all bits and pieces
of network  and the problem will only exacerbate with
further growth in the size of networks with paradigms such as
becoming the Internet of things IoT An MLbased network
management system NMS is desirable in such large net
works so that faultsbottlenecksanomalies may be predicted
in advance with reasonable accuracy In this regard networks
already have ample amount of untapped data which can pro
vide us with decisionmaking insights making networks more
efcient and selfadapting With unsupervised ML the pipe
dream is that every algorithm for adjusting network parame
ters be it TCP congestion window or rerouting network traf
c during peak time will optimize itself in a selforganizing
fashion according to the environment and application user
and network Quality of Service QoS requirements and
constraints  Unsupervised ML methods in concert with
existing supervised ML methods can provide a more efcient
method that lets a network manage monitor and optimize
itself while keeping the human administrators in the loop with
the provisioning of timely actionable informationNext generation networks are expected to be selfdriven
which means they have the ability to selfcongure optimize
and heal  All these selfdriven properties can be achieved
by building articial intelligence in the system using Mtechniques Selfdriven networks are supposed to utilize the
network data to perform networking chores and most of
the network data is imbalanced and unlabeled In order to
develop a reliable datadriven network data quality must be
taken care before subjecting it to an appropriate unsupervisedML  Unsupervised ML techniques facilitate the analy
sis of raw datasets thereby helping in generating analytic
insights from unlabeled data Recent advances in hierarchicalearning clustering algorithms factor analysis latent models
and outlier detection have helped signicantly advance the
state of the art in unsupervised ML techniques In particular
recent unsupervised ML advancessuch as the development
of deep learning techniques have however signif
icantly advanced the ML state of the art by facilitating the
processing of raw data without requiring careful engineering
and domain expertise for feature crafting Deep learning is
a class of machine learning where hierarchical architectures
are used for unsupervised feature learning and these learned
features are then used for classication and other related tasks
 The versatility of deep learning and distributed Mcan be seen in the diversity of their applications that range
from selfdriving cars to the reconstruction of brain circuits
 Unsupervised learning is also often used in conjunction
with supervised learning in semisupervised learning setting
to preprocess the data before analysis and thereby help in
crafting a good feature representation and in nding patterns
and structures in unlabeled dataThe rapid advances in deep neural networks the democ
ratization of enormous computing capabilities through cloud
computing and distributed computing and the ability to store
and process large swathes of data have motivated a surging
interest in applying unsupervised ML techniques in the net
working eld The eld of networking also appears to be wesuited to and amenable to applications of unsupervised Mtechniques due to the largely distributed decisionmaking
nature of its protocols the availability of large amounts of
network data and the urgent need for intelligentcognitive
networking Consider the case of routing in networks Net
works these days have evolved to be very complex and
they incorporate multiple physical paths for redundancy and
utilize complex routing methodologies to direct the trafcThe application trafc does not always take the optimapath we would expect leading to unexpected and inefcient
routing performance To tame such complexity unsupervised
ML techniques can autonomously selforganize the network
taking into account a number of factors such as realtime
network congestion statistics as well as application QoS
requirements The purpose of this paper is to highlight the important
advances in unsupervised learning and after providing a
tutorial introduction to these techniques to review how such
techniques have been or could be used for various tasks in
modern nextgeneration networks comprising both computer
networks as well as mobile telecom networksA CONTRIBUTION OF THE PAPER

techniques into six major categories hierarchical learning

highlighting signicant applications of unsupervised Mtechniques in networking domainA HIERARCHICAL LEARNING
Hierarchicalearning is dened as learning simple and
complex features from a hierarchy of multiple linear and
nonlinear activations In learning models a feature is a mea
surable property of the input data Desired features are ideally
informative discriminative and independent In statistics
features are also known as explanatory or independent vari
ables  Feature learning also known as data representa
tion learning is a set of techniques that can learn one or moreVOLUME 7FIGURE 1 Outline of the paperFIGURE 2 Taxonomy of unsupervised learning techniquesfeatures from input data  It involves the transformation
of raw data into a quantiable and comparable representation
which is specic to the property of the input but generaenough for comparison to similar inputs Conventionally
features are handcrafted specic to the application on handIt relies on domain knowledge but even then they do not
generalize well to the variation of realworld data whichgives rise to automated learning of generalized features from
the underlying structure of the input data Like other learning
algorithms feature learning is also divided among domains
of supervised and unsupervised learning depending on the
type of available data Almost all unsupervised learning
algorithms undergo a stage of feature extraction in order to
learn data representation from unlabeled data and generateVOLUME 7TABLE 2 List of common acronyms usedtransformation layers a machine can selflearn a very com
plex model or representation of data Learning takes place
in hidden layers and the optimal weights and biases of the
neurons are updated in two passes namely the forward pass
and backward pass A typical ANN and typical cyclic and
acyclic topologies of interconnection between neurons are
shown in Figure 3 A brief taxonomy of Unsupervised NNs
is presented in Figureeach having differentAn ANN has three types oflayers namely input

hidden and output
parameters Learning is the process of assigning optimaactivation parameters enabling ANN to perform input to
output mapping For a given problem an ANN may require
multiple hidden layers involving a long chain of computa
tions ie its depth  Deep learning has revolutionized
ML and is now increasingly being used in diverse settings
eg object identication in images speech transcription into
text matching users interests with items such as news items
movies products and making recommendations etc But
until 2006 relatively few people were interested in deep
learning due to the high computational cost of deep learning
procedures It was widely believed that training deep learning
architectures in an unsupervised manner was intractable and
supervised the training of deep NNs DNN also showed poor
performance with large generalization errors  However
recent advances 1 UNSUPERVISED MULTILAYER FEED FORWARD NN
Unsupervised multilayer feedforward NN with reference
to graph theory has a directed graph topology as shown
in Figure 3 It consists of no cycles ie does not have a feed
back path in input propagation through NN Such kind of NN
is often used to approximate a nonlinear mapping between
inputs and required outputs Autoencoders are the prime
examples of unsupervised multilayer feedforward NNsa AUTOENCODERS
An autoencoder is an unsupervised learning algorithm for
ANN used to learn compressed and encoded representation
of data mostly for dimensionality reduction and for unsu
pervised pretraining of feedforward NNs Autoencoders are
generally designed using approximation function and trained
using backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent SGDtechniques Autoencoders are the rst of their kind to use
the backpropagation algorithm to train with unlabeled dataAutoencoders aim to learn a compact representation of the
function of input using the same number of input and output
units with usually less hidden units to encode a feature vectorThey learn the input data function by recreating the input
at the output which is called encodingdecoding to learna feature vector on the basis of which further tasks are
performedHierarchical learning is intimately related to how deep
learning is performed in modern multilayer neural networksIn particular deep learning techniques benets from the
fundamental concept of articial neural networks ANNs
a deep structure consists of multiple hidden layers with mul
tiple neurons in each layer a nonlinear activation function
a cost function and a backpropagation algorithm Deep

learns a lowdimensional representation of the input data by
exploiting similar recurring patternsAutoencoders have different variants 2 UNSUPERVISED COMPETITIVE LEARNING NN
Unsupervised competitive learning NNs is a winnertakeaneuron scheme where each neuron competes for the right of
the response to a subset of the input data This scheme is used
to remove the redundancies from the unstructured data Two
major techniques of unsupervised competitive learning NNs
are selforganizing maps and adaptive resonance theory NNsa SELFORGANIZING KOHONEN MAPS
SelfOrganizing Maps SOM also known as Kohonens
maps   are a special class of NNs that uses the
concept of competitive learning in which output neurons
compete amongst themselves to be activated in a realvalued
output results having only single neuron or group of neu
rons called winning neuron This is achieved by creat
ing lateral inhibition connections negative feedback pathsbetween neurons  In this orientation the network deter
mines the winning neuron within several iterations subse
quently it is forced to reorganize itself based on the input data
distribution hence they are called SelfOrganizing MapsThey were initially inspired by the human brain which has
specialized regions in which different sensory inputs are rep
resentedprocessed by topologically ordered computationamaps In SOM neurons are arranged on vertices of a lattice
commonly one or two dimensions The network is forced
to represent higherdimensional data in lowerdimensionarepresentation by preserving the topological properties of
input data by using neighborhood function while transform
ing the input into a topological space in which neuron posi
tions in the space are representatives of intrinsic statisticaVOLUME 7features that tell us about the inherently nonlinear nature
of SOMsTraining a network comprising SOM is essentially a
threestage process after random initialization of weighted
connections The three stages are as follow  Competition Each neuron in the network computes its
value using a discriminant function which provides the
basis of competition among the neurons Neuron with
the largest discriminant value in the competition group
is declared the winner Cooperation The winner neuron then locates the center
of the topological neighborhood of excited neurons in
the previous stage providing a basis for cooperation
among excited neighboring neurons Adaption The excited neurons in the neighborhood
increasedecrease their individual values of the discrimi
nant function in regard to input data distribution through
subtle adjustments such that the response of the winning
neuron is enhanced for similar subsequent input Adap
tion stage is distinguishable into two substages 1 the
ordering or selforganizing phase in which weight vec
tors are reordered according to topological space and
2 the convergence phase in which the map is ne
tuned and declared accurate to provide statistical quan
tication of the input space This is the phase in which
the map is declared to be converged and hence trainedOne essentiain training a SOM is the
redundancy of the input data to learn about the underlying
structure of neuron activation patterns Moreover sufcient
quantity of data is required for creating distinguishable clus
ters withstanding enough data for classication problem
there exist a problem of gray area between clusters and cre
ation of innitely small clusters where input data has minimapatternsrequirementb ADAPTIVE RESONANCE THEORY
Adaptive Resonance Theory ART is another different cat
egory of NN models that is based on the theory of human
cognitive information processing It can be explained as an
algorithm of incremental clustering which aims at forming
multidimensional clusters automatically discriminating and
creating new categories based on input data Primarily ART
models are classied as an unsupervised learning model
however there exist ART variants that employ supervised
and semisupervised learning approaches as well The main
setback of most NN models is that they lose old information
updatingdiminishing weights as new information arrives
therefore an ideal model should be exible enough to accom
modate new information without losing the old one and this
is called the plasticitystability problem ART models provide
a solution to this problem by selforganizing in real time and
creating a competitive environment for neurons automati
cally discriminatingcreating new clusters among neurons to
accommodate any new informationART moderesonates around topdown observer
expectations and bottomup sensory information whilekeeping their difference within the threshold limits of vigi
lance parameter which in result is considered as the member
of the expected class of neurons  Learning of an ART
model primarily consists of a comparison eld recognition
eld vigilance threshold parameter and a reset moduleThe comparison eld takes an input vector which in result is
passed to best match in the recognition eld the best match
is the current winning neuron Each neuron in the recognition
eld passes a negative output in proportion to the quality of
the match which inhibits other outputs therefore exhibiting
lateral inhibitions competitions Once the winning neuron
is selected after a competition with the best match to the input
vector the reset module compares the quality of the match to
the vigilance threshold If the winning neuron is within the
threshold it is selected as the output else the winning neuron
is reset and the process is started again to nd the next best
match to the input vector In case where no neuron is capable
to pass the threshold test a search procedure begins in which
the reset module disables recognition neurons one at a time to
nd a correct match whose weight can be adjusted to accom
modate the new match therefore ART models are called self
organizing and can deal with the plasticitystability dilemma3 UNSUPERVISED DEEP NN
In recent years unsupervised deep NN has become the most
successful unsupervised structure due to its application in
many benchmarking problems and applications  Three
major types of unsupervised deep NNs are deep belief NNs
deep autoencoders and convolutional NNsa DEEP BELIEF NN
Deep Belief Neural Network or simply Deep Belief Networks
DBN is a probabilitybased generative graph model that is
composed of hierarchical layers of stochastic latent variables
having binary valued activations which are referred as hidden
units or feature detectors The top layers in DBNs have
undirected symmetric connections between them forming
an associative memory DBNs provide a breakthrough in
unsupervised learning paradigm In the learning stage DBN
learns to reconstruct its input each layer acting as feature
detectors DBN can be trained by greedy layerwise training
starting from the top layer with raw input subsequent layers
are trained with the input data from the previously visible
layer  Once the network is trained in an unsupervised
manner and learned the distribution of the data it can be
netuned using supervised learning methods or supervised
layers can be concatenated in order to achieve the desired task
for instance classicationb DEEP AUTOENCODER
Another famous type of DBN is the deep autoencoder which
is composed of two symmetric DBNsthe rst of which is
used to encode the input vector while the second decodesBy the end of the training of the deep autoencoder it tends
to reconstruct the input vector at the output neurons andVOLUME 7therefore the central layer between both DBNs is the actuacompressed feature vectorc CONVOLUTIONAL NN
Convolutional NN CNN are feed forward NN in which
neurons are adapted to respond to overlapping regions in
twodimensional input elds such as visual or audio inputIt is commonly achieved by local sparse connections among
successive layers and tied shared weights followed by rec
tifying and pooling layers which results in transformation
invariant feature extraction Another advantage of CNN over
simple multilayer NN is that it is comparatively easier to train
due to sparsely connected layers with the same number of
hidden units CNN represents the most signicant type of
architecture for computer vision as they solve two challenges
with the conventional NNs 1 scalable and computationally
tractable algorithms are needed for processing high
dimensional images and 2 algorithms should be transfor
mation invariant since objects in an image can occur at an
arbitrary position However most CNNs are composed of
supervised feature detectors in the lower and middle hidden
layers In order to extract features in an unsupervised manner
a hybrid of CNN and DBN called Convolutional Deep Belief
Network CDBN is proposed in  Making probabilistic
maxpooling1 to cover larger input area and convolution as
an inference algorithm makes this model scalable with higher
dimensional input Learning is processed in an unsupervised
manner as proposed in  ie greedy layerwise lower to
higher training with unlabeled dataCDBN is a promising scalable generative model for learn
ing translation invariant hierarchical representation from any
highdimensional unlabeled data in an unsupervised man
ner taking advantage of both worlds ie DBN and CNNCNN being widely employed for computer vision applica
tions can be employed in computer networks for optimiza
tion of Quality of Experience QoE and Quality of Service
QoS of multimedia content delivery over networks which
is an open research problem for nextgeneration computer
networks 4 UNSUPERVISED RECURRENT NN
Recurrent NN RNN is the most complex type of NN
and hence the nearest match to an actual human brain that
processes sequential inputs It can learn temporal behaviors
of a given training data RNN employs an internal memory
per neuron to process such sequential inputs in order to
exhibit the effect of the previous event on the next Compared
to feed forward NNs RNN is a stateful network It may
contain computational cycles among states and uses time
as the parameter in the transition function from one unit to
another Being complex and recently developed it is an open
research problem to create domainspecic RNN models and
train them with sequential data Specically there are two1Maxpooling is an algorithm of selecting the most responsive receptiveeld of a given interest regionperspectives of RNN to be discussed in the scope of this
survey namely the depth of the architecture and the training
of the network The depth in the case of a simple articiaNN is the presence of hierarchical nonlinear intermediate
layers between the input and output signals In the case of an
RNN there are different hypotheses explaining the concept
of depth One hypothesis suggests that RNNs are inherently
deep in nature when expanded with respect to sequentiainput there are a series of nonlinear computations between
the input at time ti and the output at time ti  kHowever at an individual discrete time step certain tran
sitions are neither deep nor nonlinear There exist inputto
hidden hiddentohidden and hiddentooutput transitions
which are shallow in the sense that there are no intermediate
nonlinear layers at discrete time step In this regard different
deep architectures are proposed in Due to the inherently complex nature of RNN to the best
of our knowledge there is no widely adopted approach for
training RNNs and many novel methods both supervised
and unsupervised are introduced to train RNNs Considering
unsupervised learning of RNN in the scope of this paper a HOPFIELD NN
Hopeld NN is a cyclic recurrent NN where each node is
connected to others Hopeld NN provides an abstraction
of circular shift register memory with nonlinear activation
functions to form a global energy function with guaranteed
convergence to local minima Hopeld NNs are used for
nding clusters in the data without a supervisorb BOLTZMANN MACHINE
The Boltzmann machine is a stochastic symmetric recur
rent NN that is used for search and learning problemsDue to binary vector based simple learning algorithm of
Boltzmann machine very interesting features representing
the complex unstructured data can be learned  Since
the Boltzmann machine uses multiple hidden layers as fea
ture detectors the learning algorithm becomes very slowTo avoid slow learning and to achieve faster feature detection
instead of Boltzmann machine a faster version namely the
restricted Boltzmann machine RBM is used for practicaVOLUME 7FIGURE 5 Clustering processproblems  Restricted Boltzmann machine learns a prob
ability distribution over its input data but since it is restricted
in its layer to layer connectivity RBM loses its property of
recurrence It is faster than a Boltzmann machine because it
only uses one hidden layer as a feature detector layer RBM
is used for dimensionality reduction clustering and feature
learning in computer networks5 SIGNIFICANT APPLICATIONS OF HIERARCHICALEARNING IN NETWORKS
ANNsDNNs are the most researched topic when creat
ing intelligent systems in computer vision and natural lan
guage processing whereas their application in computer
networks are very limited they are employed in differ
ent networking applications such as classication of trafc
anomalyintrusion detection detecting Distributed Denial of
Service DDoS attacks and resource management in cogni
tive radios  The motivation of using DNN for learning
and predicting in networks is the unsupervised training that
detects hidden patterns in ample amount of data that is near
to impossible for a human to handcraft features catering for
all scenarios Moreover many new research shows that a
single model is not enough for the need of some applications
so developing a hybrid NN architecture having pros and
cons of different models creates a new efcient NN which
provides even better results Such an approach is used in 
in which a hybrid model of ART and RNN is employed to
learn and predict trafc volume in a computer network in
real time Realtime prediction is essential to adaptive ow
control which is achieved by using hybrid techniques so that
ART can learn new input patterns without retraining the
entire network and can predict accurately in the time series
of RNN Furthermore DNNs are also being used in resource
allocation and QoEQoS optimizations Using NN for opti
mization efcient resource allocation without affecting the
user experience can be crucial in the time when resources are
scarce Authors of  B DATA CLUSTERING
Clustering is an unsupervised learning task that aims to nd
hidden patterns in unlabeled input data in the form of clus
ters  Simply put it encompasses the arrangement of data
in meaningful natural groupings on the basis of the similarity
between different features as illustrated in Figure 5 to learn
about its structure Clustering involves the organization of
data in such a way that there are high intracluster and low
intercluster similarity The resulting structured data is termed
as dataconcept  Clustering is used in numerous applica
tions from the elds of ML data mining network analysis
pattern recognition and computer vision The various tech
niques used for data clustering are described in more detailater in Section IIB In networking clustering techniques
are widely deployed for applications such as trafc analysis
and anomaly detection in all kinds of networks eg wireless
sensor networks and mobile adhoc networks with anomaly
detection Clustering improves performance in various applicationsMcGregor et al A brief overview of different types of clustering methods
and their relationships can be seen in Figure 6 Clustering can
be divided into three main types  namely hierarchicaclustering Bayesian clustering and partitional clusteringHierarchical clustering creates a hierarchical decomposition
of data whereas Bayesian clustering forms a probabilistic
model of the data that decides the fate of a new test point
probabilistically In contrast partitional clustering constructs
multiple partitions and evaluates them on the basis of certain
criterion or characteristic such as the Euclidean distanceBefore delving into the general subtypes of clustering
there are two unique clustering techniques which need to be
discussed namely densitybased clustering and gridbased
clustering In some cases densitybased clustering is classi
ed as a partitional clustering technique however we have
kept it separate considering its applications in networkingDensitybased models target the most densely populated area
of data space and separate it from areas having low densities
thus forming clusters  VOLUME 7TABLE 3 Applications of hierarchical learning deep learning in networking applicationsFIGURE 6 Clustering taxonomyapplications eg intrusion detection in networks Another
technique is gridbased clustering which divides the data
space into cells to form a gridlike structure subsequently
all clustering actions are performed on this grid  We move on next to describe three major types of data clus
tering approaches as per the taxonomy is shown in Figure1 HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING
Hierarchical clustering is a wellknown strategy in data min
ing and statistical analysis in which data is clustered into a
hierarchy of clusters using an agglomerative bottomup or a
divisive topdown approach Almost all hierarchical clus
tering algorithms are unsupervised and deterministic The
primary advantage of hierarchical clustering over unsuper
vised Kmeans and EM algorithms is that it does not require
the number of clusters to be specied beforehand However
this advantage comes at the cost of computational efciencyCommon hierarchical clustering algorithms have at leastVOLUME 7quadratic computational complexity compared to the linear
complexity of Kmeans and EM algorithms Hierarchicaclustering methods have a pitfall these methods fail to accu
rately classify messy highdimensional data as its heuristic
may fail due to the structural imperfections of empiricadata Furthermore the computational complexity of the com
mon agglomerative hierarchical algorithms is NPhard SOM
as discussed in Section IIA2 is a modern approach that can
overcome the shortcomings of hierarchical models 2 BAYESIAN CLUSTERING
Bayesian clustering is a probabilistic clustering strategy
where the posterior distribution of the data is learned on the
basis of a prior probability distribution Bayesian clustering
is divided into two major categories namely parametric and
nonparametric  The major difference between para
metric and nonparametric techniques is the dimensionality
of parameter space if there are nite dimensions in the
parameter space the underlying technique is called Bayesian
parametric otherwise the underlying technique is called
Bayesian nonparametric A major pitfall with the Bayesian
clustering approach is that the choice of the wrong prior prob
ability distributions can distort the projection of the data 3 PARTITIONAL CLUSTERING
Partitional clustering corresponds to a special class of cluster
ing algorithms that decomposes data into a set of disjoint clus
ters Given n observations the clustering algorithm partitions
a data into k  n clusters  Partitional clustering is further
classied into Kmeans clustering and mixture modelsa KMEANS CLUSTERING
Kmeans clustering is a simple yet widely used approach
for classication It takes a statistical vector as an input to
deduce classication models or classiers Kmeans cluster
ing tends to distribute m observations into n clusters where
each observation belongs to the nearest cluster The member
ship of observation to a cluster is determined using the cluster
mean Kmeans clustering is used in numerous applications
in the domains of network analysis and trafc classica
tion Kmeans clustering is also used in the domain of network
security and intrusion detection Reference algorithm have demonstrated a better ability to search clusters
globallyAnother variation of Kmeans is known as Kmedoids
in which rather than taking the mean of the clusters the most
centrally located data point of a cluster is considered as the
reference point of the corresponding cluster  Few of
the applications of Kmedoids in the spectrum of anomaly
detection can be seen here  b MIXTURE MODELS
Mixture models are powerful probabilistic models for uni
variate and multivariate data Mixture models are used to
make statistical inferences and deductions about the prop
erties of the subpopulations given only observations on the
pooled population They have also used to statistically modedata in the domains of pattern recognition computer vision
ML etc Finite mixtures which are a basic type of mixture
model naturally model observations that are produced by
a set of alternative random sources Inferring and deduc
ing different parameters from these sources based on their
respective observations lead to clustering of the set of obser
vations This approach to clustering tackles drawbacks of
heuristicbased clustering methods and hence it is proven to
be an efcient method for node classication in any large
scale network and has shown to yield effective results com
pared to techniques commonly used For instance Kmeans
and hierarchical agglomerative methods rely on supervised
design decisions such as the number of clusters or validity
of models  Moreover combining the EM algorithm with
mixture models produces remarkable results in deciphering
the structure and topology of the vertices connected through a
multidimensional network  Reference 4 SIGNIFICANT APPLICATIONS OF
CLUSTERING IN NETWORKS
Clustering can be found in mostly all unsupervised learning
problems and there are diverse applications of clustering
in the domain of computer networks Two major network
ing applications where signicant use of clustering can be
seen are intrusion detection and Internet trafc classica
tion One novel way to detect anomaly is proposed in 
this approach preprocesses the data using Genetic Algo
rithm GA combined with hierarchical clustering approach
called Balanced Iterative Reducing using Clustering Hier
archies BIRCH to provide an efcient classier based on
Support Vector Machine SVM This hierarchical cluster
ing approach stores abstracted data points instead of the
whole dataset thus giving more accurate and quick clas
sication compared to all past methods producing bet
ter results in detecting anomalies Another approach VOLUME 7TABLE 4 Applications of data clustering in networking applicationsBasically a scalable parallel framework for clustering large
datasets with high dimensions is proposed and then improved
by inculcating frequency pattern trees Table 4 also provides
a tabulated description of data clustering applications in net
works These are just a few notable examples of clustering
approaches in networks refer to Section III for the detailed
discussion on some salient clustering applications in the con
text of networksC LATENT VARIABLE MODELS
A latent variable model is a statistical model that relates
the manifest variables with a set of latent or hidden vari
ables Latent variable model allows us to express relatively
complex distributions in terms of tractable joint distributions
over an expanded variable space  Underlying variables
of a process are represented in higher dimensional space
using a xed transformation and stochastic variations are
known as latent variable models where the distribution in
higher dimension is due to small number of hidden variables
acting in a combination  These models are used for
data visualization dimensionality reduction optimization
distribution learning blind signal separation and factor anal
ysis Next we will begin our discussion on various latent
variable models namely mixture distribution factor analysis
blind signal separation nonnegative matrix factorization
Bayesian networks  probabilistic graph models PGM
hidden Markov model HMM and nonlinear dimensional
ity reduction techniques which further includes generative
topographic mapping multidimensional scaling principacurves Isomap localliy linear embedding and tdistributed
stochastic neighbor embedding1 MIXTURE DISTRIBUTION
Mixture distribution is an important latent variable modethat is used for estimating the underlying density functionMixture distribution provides a general framework for den
sity estimation by using the simpler parametric distributionsExpectation maximization EM algorithm is used for esti
mating the mixture distribution model  through max
imization of the loglikelihood of the mixture distribution
mode2 FACTOR ANALYSIS
Another important type of latent variable model is factor
analysis which is a density estimation model It has been
used quite often in collaborative ltering and dimensionality
reduction It is different from other latent variable models
in terms of the allowed variance for different dimensions
as most latent variable models for dimensionality reduction
in conventional settings use a xed variance Gaussian noise
model In the factor analysis model latent variables have
diagonal covariance rather than isotropic covariance3 BLIND SIGNAL SEPARATION
Blind Signal Separation BSS also referred to as Blind
Source Separation is the identication and separation of
independent source signals from mixed input signals with
out or very little information about the mixing processFigure 7 depicts the basic BSS process in which source
signals are extracted from a mixture of signals It is a funda
mental and challenging problem in the domain of signal pro
cessing although the concept is extensively used in all types of
multidimensional data processing Most common techniques
employed for BSS are principal component analysis PCAand independent component analysis ICAa Principal Component Analysis PCA is a statisti
cal procedure that utilizes orthogonatransformation on
the data to convert n number of possibly correlated vari
ables into lesser k number of uncorrelated variables namedVOLUME 7FIGURE 7 Blind signal separation BSS A mixed signal composed of various input signals mixed by some
mixing process is blindly processed ie with no or minimal information about the mixing process to
show the original signalsprincipal components Principal components are arranged in
the descending order of their variability rst one catering
for the most variable and the last one for the least Being a
primary technique for exploratory data analysis PCA takes a
cloud of data in n dimensions and rotates it such that maxi
mum variability in the data is visible Using this technique
it brings out the strong patterns in the dataset so that these
patterns are more recognizable thereby making the data easier
to explore and visualizePCA has primarily been used for dimensionality reduction
in which input data of n dimensions is reduced to k dimen
sions without losing critical information in the data The
choice of the number of principal components is a question
of the design decision Much research has been conducted on
selecting the number of components such as crossvalidation
approximations  Optimally k is chosen such that the
ratio of the average squared projection error to the totavariation in the data is less than or equal to 1 by which
99 of the variance is retained in the k principal componentsBut depending on the application domain different designs
can increasedecrease the ratio while maximizing the required
output Commonly many features of a dataset are often
highly correlated hence PCA results in retaining 99 of the
variance while signicantly reducing the data dimensionsb Independent Component Analysis ICA is another tech
nique for BSS that focuses on separating multivariate input
data into additive components with the underlying assump
tion that the components are nonGaussian and statistically
independent The most common example to understand ICA
is the cocktail party problem in which there are n people
talking simultaneously in a room and one tries to listen to
a single voice ICA actually separates source signals from
input mixed signal by either minimizing the statistical depen
dence or maximizing the nonGaussian property among the
components in the input signals by keeping the underly
ing assumptions valid Statistically ICA can be seen as the
extension of PCA while PCA tries to maximize the second
moment variance of data hence relying heavily on Gaussian
features on the other hand ICA exploits inherently non
Gaussian features of the data and tries to maximize the fourth
moment of linear combination of inputs to extract nonnormasource components in the data 4 NONNEGATIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION
NonNegative Matrix Factorization NMF is a technique to
factorize a large matrix into two or more smaller matrices
with no negative values that is when multiplied it recon
structs the approximate original matrix NMF is a novemethod in decomposing multivariate data making it easy
and straightforward for exploratory analysis By NMF hid
den patterns and intrinsic features within the data can be
identied by decomposing them into smaller chunks enhanc
ing the interpretability of data for analysis with posi
tivity constraints However
there exist many classes of
algorithms 5 HIDDEN MARKOV MODEHidden Markov Models HMM are stochastic models of
great utility especially in domains where we wish to analyze
temporal or dynamic processes such as speech recognition
primary users PU arrival pattern in cognitive radio net
works CRNs etc HMMs are highly relevant to CRNs since
many environmental parameters in CRNs are not directly
observable An HMMbased approach can analytically modea Markovian stochastic process in which we do not have
access to the actual states which are assumed to be unob
served or hidden instead we can observe a state that is
stochastically dependent on the hidden state It is for this
reason that an HMM is dened to be a doubly stochastic
process6 BAYESIAN NETWORKS  PROBABILISTIC
GRAPH MODELS PGMIn Bayesian learning we try to nd the posterior proba
bility distributions for all parameter settings in this setup
we ensure that we have a posterior probability for every
possible parameter setting It is computationally expensive
but we can use complicated models with a small dataset and
still avoid overtting Posterior probabilities are calculated by
dividing the product of sampling distribution and prior dis
tribution by marginal likelihood in simple words posteriorVOLUME 7probabilities are calculated using Bayes theorem The basis
of reinforcement learning was also derived by using Bayes
theorem  Since Bayesian learning is computationally
expensive a new research trend is approximate Bayesian
learning  Authors in Probabilistic graph modeling is a concept associated with
Bayesian learning A model representing the probabilistic
relationship between random variables through a graph is
known as a probabilistic graph model PGM Nodes and
edges in the graph represent a random variable and their prob
abilistic dependence respectively PGM are of two typesdirected PGM and undirected PGM Bayes networks also
fall in the regime of directed PGM PGM is used in many
important areas such as computer vision speech processing
and communication systems Bayesian learning combined
with PGM and latent variable models forms a probabilistic
framework where deep learning is used as a substrate for mak
ing improved learning architecture for recommender systems

set of statistical algorithms that are widely used in differ
ent application domains to perform different tasks such as
dimensionality reduction correlating and mapping features

nd the degree of condence in detecting an anomaly in
wireless networks  Furthermore PCA is also chosen
as a method of clustering and designing Wireless Sensor

posterior probability distributions For early trafc identi
cation in campus network real discretized conditional proba
bility has been used to construct a Bayesian classier Hostlevel intrusion detection using Bayesian networks is
proposed in  Authors in D DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION
Representing data in fewer dimensions is another well
established task of unsupervised learning Real world data
often have high dimensionsin many datasets these dimen
sions can run into thousands even millions of potentially
correlated dimensions  However it is observed that the
intrinsic dimensionality governing parameters of the data is
less than the total number of dimensions In order to nd the
essential pattern of the underlying data by extracting intrinsic
dimensions it is necessary that the real essence is not lost
eg it may be the case that a phenomenon is observable
only in higherdimensional data and is suppressed in lower
dimensions these phenomena are said to suffer from the
curse of dimensionality  While dimensionality reduc
tion is sometimes used interchangeably with feature selection
  a subtle difference exists between the two Feature selection is traditionally performed as a supervised
task with a domain expert helping in handcrafting a set of
critical features of the data Such an approach generally
can perform well but is not scalable and prone to judgment
bias Dimensionality reduction on the other hand is more
generally an unsupervised task where instead of choosing
a subset of features it creates new features dimensions as
a function of all features Said differently feature selection
considers supervised data labels while dimensionality reduc
tion focuses on the data points and their distributions in an
Ndimensional spaceThere exist different techniques for reducing data dimen
sionsVOLUME 7TABLE 5 Applications of latent variable models in networking applicationsBy creating representative functional dimensions of the data
and eliminating redundant ones it becomes easier to visualize
and form a learning model Independent representation tries
to disconnect the source of variation underlying the data
distribution such that the dimensions of the representation
are statistically independent  Sparse representation tech
nique represents the data vectors in linear combinations of
small basis vectorsIt is worth noting here that many of the latent variable mod
els eg PCA ICA factor analysis also function as tech
niques for dimensionality reduction In addition to techniques
such as PCA ICAwhich infer the latent inherent structure
of the data through a linear projection of the dataa number
of nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques have also
been developed and will be focused upon in this section to
avoid repetition of linear dimensionality reduction techniques
that have already been covered as part of the previous subsec
tion Linear dimensionality reduction techniques are useful in
many settings but these methods may miss important nonlin
ear structure in the data due to their subspace assumption
which posits that the highdimensional data points lie on a
linear subspace for example on a 2D or 3D plane Such
an assumption fails in high dimensions when data points are
random but highly correlated with neighbors In such environ
ments nonlinear dimensionality reductions through manifold
learning techniqueswhich can be construed as an attempt
to generalize linear frameworks like PCA so that nonlinear
structure in data can also be recognizedbecome desirableEven though some supervised variants also exist manifold
learning is mostly performed in an unsupervised fashion
using the nonlinear manifold substructure learned from the
highdimensional structure of the data from the data itself
without the use of any predetermined classier or labeled
data Some nonlinear dimensionality reduction manifold
learning techniques are described below1 ISOMAP
Isomap is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that
nds the underlying low dimensional geometric information
about a dataset Algorithmic features of PCA and MDS
are combined to learn the low dimensional nonlinear man
ifold structure in the data  Isomap uses geodesic dis
tance along the shortest path to calculate the low dimension
representation shortest path which can be computed using
Dijkstras algorithm2 GENERATIVE TOPOGRAPHIC MODErepresents the
Generative topographic mapping GTMnonlinear latent variable mapping from continuous low
dimensional distributions embedded in high dimensionaspaces  Data space in GTM is represented as reference
vectors and these vectors are a projection of latent points in
data space It is a probabilistic variant of SOM and works
by calculating the Euclidean distance between data pointsGTM optimizes the loglikelihood function and the resulting
probability denes the density in data spaceVOLUME 7TABLE 6 Applications of dimensionality reduction in networking applications3 LOCALLY LINEAR EMBEDDING

distributions Table 6 also provides a tabulated description of dimen
sionality reduction applications in networking The applica
tions of nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods are later
described in detail in Section IIIDE OUTLIER DETECTION
Outlier detection is an important application of unsupervised
learning A sample point that is distant from other samples is
called an outlier An outlier may occur due to noise measure
ment error heavy tail distributions and a mixture of two dis
tributions There are two popular underlying techniques for
unsupervised outlier detection upon which many algorithms
are designed namely the nearest neighbor based technique
and clustering based method1 NEAREST NEIGHBOR BASED OUTLIER DETECTION
The nearest neighbor method works on estimating the
Euclidean distances or average distance of every sample from
all other samples in the dataset There are many algorithms
based on nearest neighbor based techniques with the most
famous extension of the nearest neighbor being a knearest
neighbor technique in which only k nearest neighbors par
ticipate in the outlier detection  Local outlier factor is
another outlier detection algorithm which works as an exten
sion of the knearest neighbor algorithm Connectivitybased

Clustering based methods use the conventional Kmeans
clustering technique to nd dense locations in the data and
then perform density estimation on those clusters After den
sity estimation a heuristic is used to classify the formed clus
ter according to the cluster size Anomaly score is computed
by calculating the distance between every point and its cluster
head Local density cluster based outlier factor  cluster
ing based multivariate Gaussian outlier score  3 SIGNIFICANT APPLICATIONS OF OUTLIER
DETECTION IN NETWORKS
Outlier detection algorithms are used in many different appli
cations such as intrusion detection fraud detection data leak
age prevention surveillance energy consumption anomalies
forensic analysis critical state detection in designs elec
trocardiogram and computed tomography scan for tumor
detection Unsupervised anomaly detection is performed by
estimating the distances and densities of the provided non
annotated data  More applications of outlier detection
schemes will be discussed in SectionF LESSONS LEARNT
Key lessons drawn from the review of unsupervised learning
techniques are summarized below1 Hierarchical learning techniques are the most pop
ular schemes in literature for feature detection and
extraction2 Learning the joint distribution of a complex distribution
over an expanded variable space is a difcult taskLatent variable models have been the recommended
and wellestablished schemes in literature for this prob
lem These models are also used for dimensionality
reduction and better representation of data3 Visualization of unlabeled multidimensional data is
another unsupervised task In this research we have
explored the dimensionality reduction as an underlying
scheme for developing better multidimensional data

LEARNING IN NETWORKING
In this section we will introduce some signicant appli
cations of the unsupervised learning techniques that have
been discussed in Section II in the context of computer net
works We highlight the broad spectrum of applications in
networking and emphasize the importance of MLbased tech
niques rather than classical hardcoded statistical methods
for achieving more efciency adaptability and performance
enhancementA INTERNET TRAFFIC CLASSIFICATION
Internet trafc classication is of prime importance in net
working as it provides a way to understand develop andmeasure the Internet Internet trafc classication is an
important component for service providers to understand
the characteristics of the service such as quality of service
quality of experience user behavior network security and
many other key factors related to the overall structure of a
network  In this subsection we will survey the unsuper
vised learning applications in network trafc classicationAs networks evolve at a rapid pace malicious intruders are
also evolving their strategies Numerous novel hacking and
intrusion techniques are being regularly introduced causing
severe nancial jolts to companies and headaches to their
administrators Tackling these unknown intrusions through
accurate trafc classication on the network edge therefore
becomes a critical challenge and an important component of
the network security domain Initially when networks used
to be small simple portbased classication technique that
tried to identify the associated application with the corre
sponding packet based on its port number was used However
this approach is now obsolete because recent malicious soft
ware uses a dynamic portnegotiation mechanism to bypass
rewalls and security applications A number of contrast
ing Internet trafc classication techniques have been pro
posed since then and some important ones are discussed
nextMost of the modern trafc classication methods use
different ML and clustering techniques to produce accurate
clusters of packets depending on their applications thus pro
ducing efcient packet classication  The main purpose
of classifying networks trafc is to recognize the destination
application of the corresponding packet and to control the
ow of the trafc when needed such as prioritizing one ow
over others Another important aspect of trafc classication
is to detect intrusions and malicious attacks or screen out
forbidden applications packetsThe rst step in classifying Internet trafc is selecting
accurate features which is an extremely important yet com
plex task Accurate feature selection helps ML algorithms
to avoid problems like class imbalance low efciency and
low classication rate There are three major feature selec
tion methods in Internet trafc for classication the l
ter method the wrapper based method and the embedded
method These methods are based on different ML and
genetic learning algorithms  Two major concerns in
feature selection for Internet trafc classication are the
large size of data and imbalanced trafc classes To deawith these issues and to ensure accurate feature selection
a minmax ensemble feature selection scheme is proposed
in  A new informationtheoretic approach for feature
selection for skewed datasets is described in  This
algorithm has resolved the multiclass imbalance issue but
it does not resolve the issues of feature selection In 2017
an unsupervised autoencoder based scheme has outperformed
previous feature learning schemes autoencoders were used
as a generative model and were trained in a way that the
bottleneck layer learned a latent representation of the feature
set these features were then used for malware classicationVOLUME 7and anomaly detection to produce results that improved the
state of the art in feature selection Much work has been done on classifying trafc based on
supervised ML techniques Initially in 2004 the concept of
clustering bidirectional ows of packets came out with the
use of EM probabilistic clustering algorithm which clusters
the ows depending on various attributes such as packet size
statistics interarrival statistics byte counts and connection
duration etc  Furthermore clustering is combined with
the above model  this strategy uses Nave Bayes clus
tering to classify trafc in an automated fashion Recently
unsupervised ML techniques have also been introduced in
the domain of network security for classifying trafc Major
developments include a hybrid model to classify trafc in
more unsupervised manner  which uses both labeled
and unlabeled data to train the classier making it more
durable and efcient However later on completely unsuper
vised methods for trafc classication have been proposed
and still much work is going on in this area Initially a com
pletely unsupervised approach for trafc classication was
employed using the Kmeans clustering algorithm combined
with log transformation to classify data into corresponding
clusters Then Another improved and faster approach was proposed
in 2006  which examines the size of the rst ve
packets and determines the application correctly using unsu
pervised learning techniques This approach has shown to
produce better results than the stateoftheart trafc classi
er and also has removed its drawbacks such as dealing
with outliers or unknown packets etc Another similar auto
mated trafc classier and application identier can be seen
in  and they use the autoclass unsupervised Bayesian
classier which automatically learns the inherent naturaclasses in a datasetIn 2013 another novel strategy for trafc classication
known as network trafc classication using correlation was
proposed  which uses nonparametric NN combined
with statistical measurement of correlation within data to
efciently classify trafc The presented approach addressed
the three major drawbacks of supervised and unsupervised
learning classication models rstly they are inappropriate
for sparse complex networks as labeling of training data takes
too much computation and time secondly many supervised
schemes such as SVM are not robust to training data size and
lastly and most importantly all supervised and unsupervised
algorithms perform poorly if there are few training samplesThus classifying the trafc using correlations appears to
be more efcient and adapting clustering process is used for Internet trafc data characteri
zation  In another work a twophased ML approach for
Internet trafc classication using Kmeans and C50 deci
sion tree is presented in A new approach for Internet trafc classication has been
introduced in 2017 by Deep belief network combined with Gaussian modeemployed for Internet trafc prediction in wireless mesh
backbone network has been shown to outperform the pre
vious maximum likelihood estimation technique for trafc
prediction  Given the uncertainty of WLAN channetrafc classication is very tricky B ANOMALYINTRUSION DETECTION
The increasing use of networks in every domain has increased
the risk of network intrusions which makes user privacy and
the security of critical data vulnerable to attacks According
to the annual computer crime and security survey 2005 
conducted by the combined teams of CSI Computer Security
Institute and FBI Federal Bureau of Investigation totanancial losses faced by companies due to the security attacks
and network intrusions were estimated as US 130 millionVOLUME 7TABLE 7 Internet traffic classification with respect to unsupervised learning techniques and tasksMoreover according to the Symantec Internet Security
Threat Report  approximately 5000 new vulnerabilities
were identied in the year 2015 In addition more than
400 million new variants of malware programs and 9 major
breaches were detected exposing 10 million identities There
fore insecurity in todays networking environment has given
rise to the everevolving domain of network security and
intrusionanomaly detection In general Intrusion Detection Systems IDS recognize
or identify any act of security breach within a computer or a
network specically all requests which could compromise
the condentiality and availability of data or resources of a
system or a particular network Generally intrusion detection
systems can be categorized into three types 1 signature
based intrusion detection systems 2 anomaly detection
systems and 3 compoundhybrid detection systems which
include selective attributes of both preceding systemsSignature detection also known as misuse detection is a
technique that was initially used for tracing and identify
ing misuses of users important data computer resources
and intrusions in the network based on the previously col
lected or stored signatures of intrusion attempts The most
important benet of a signaturebased system is that a com
puter administrator can exactly identify the type of attack a
computer is currently experiencing based on the sequence
of the packets dened by stored signatures However it is
nearly impossible to maintain the signature database of aevolving possible attacks thus this pitfall of the signature
based technique has given rise to anomaly detection systemsAnomaly Detection System ADS is a modern intrusion
and anomaly detection system Initially it creates a baseline
image of a system prole its network and user program
activity Then on the basis of this baseline image ADS classi
es any activity deviating from this behavior as an intrusionFew benets of this technique are rstly they are capableof detecting insider attacks such as using system resources
through another user prole secondly each ADS is based on
a customized user prole which makes it very difcult for
attackers to ascertain which types of attacks would not set an
alarm and lastly it detects unknown behavior in a computer
system rather than detecting intrusions thus it is capable of
detecting any unknown sophisticated attack which is different
from the users usual behavior However these benets come
with a tradeoff in which the process of training a system on
a users normal prole and maintaining those proles is a
time consuming and challenging task If an inappropriate user
prole is created it can result in poor performance Since
ADS detects any behavior that does not align with a users
normal prole its false alarm rate can be high Lastly another
pitfall of ADS is that a malicious user can train ADS gradually
to accept inappropriate trafc as normaAs anomaly and intrusion detection have been a popular
research area since the origin of networking and Internet
numerous supervised as well as unsupervised Initial work focuses on the application of basic unsu
pervised clustering algorithms for detecting intrusions and
anomalies In 2005 an unsupervised approach was proposed
based on density and gridbased clustering to accurately
classify the highdimensional dataset in a set of clusters
those points which do not fall in any cluster are marked
as abnormal  This approach has produced good results
but the false positive rate was very high In followup work
another improved approach that used fuzzy rough Cmeans
clustering was introduced   Kmeans clustering is
also another famous approach used for detecting anomaliesVOLUME 7which were later proposed in 2009  which showed great
accuracy and outperformed existing unsupervised methodsHowever later in 2012 an improved method which used
Kmeans clustering combined with the C45 decision tree
algorithm was proposed Another famous approach for increasing detection accu
racy is ensemble learning work presented in The application of unsupervised intrusion detection in
cloud network is presented in area networks wireless sensor networks cyberphysical sys
tems and WLANs are surveyed in Another paper Other than clustering another widely used unsupervised
technique for detecting malicious and abnormal behavior in
networks is SOMs The specialty of SOMs is that they can
automatically organize a variety of inputs and deduce patterns
among themselves and subsequently determine whether the
new input ts in the deduced pattern or not thus detecting
abnormal inputs   SOMs have also been used
in hostbased intrusion detection systems in which intruders
and abusers are identied at a host system through incom
ing data trafc  later on a more robust and efcient
technique was proposed to analyze data patterns in TCP
trafc  Furthermore complex NNs have also been
applied to solve the same problem and remarkable results
have been produced A few examples include the application
of ART combined with SOM  The use of PCA can also
be seen in detecting intrusions  NMF has also been
used for detecting intruders and abusers  and lastly
dimensionality reduction techniques have also been applied
to eradicate intrusions and anomalies in the system  For
more applications refer to Table 8 which classies different
network anomaly and intrusion detection systems on the basis
of unsupervised learning techniques discussed earlierC NETWORK OPERATIONS OPTIMIZATIONS


Network management comprises of aincluded in initializing monitoring and managing of a com
puter network based on its network functions which are the
primary requirements of the network operations The generapurpose of network management and monitoring systems
is to ensure that basic network functions are fullled andVOLUME 7TABLE 8 Anomaly  network intrusion detection systems ANIDS with respect to unsupervised learning techniquesif there is any malfunctioning in the network it should be
reported and addressed accordingly Following is a summary
of different network optimization tasks achieved through
unsupervised learning models1 QOSQOE OPTIMIZATION
QoS and QoE are measures of service performance and end
user experience respectively QoS mainly deals with the
performance as seen by the user being measured quantita
tively while QoE is a qualitative measure of subjective met
rics experienced by the user QoSQoE for Internet services
especially multimedia content delivery services is crucial in
order to maximize the user experience With the dynamic and
bursty nature of Internet trafc computer networks should
be able to adapt to these changes without compromising
enduser experiences As QoE is quite subjective it heavily
relies on the underlying QoS which is affected by different
network parameters References different measurable factors to determine the overall approx
imation of QoS such as error rates bit rate throughput trans
mission delay availability jitters etc Furthermore these
factors are used to correlate QoS with QoE in the perspective
of video streaming where QoE is essential to endusersThe dynamic nature of the Internet dictates network design
for different applications to maximize QoSQoE since there
is no predened adaptive algorithm that can be used to fulall the necessary requirements for prospective applicationDue to this fact ML approaches are employed in order to
adapt to the realtime network conditions and take measures
to stabilizemaximize the user experience Reference VOLUME 7classier Similarly Moreover research has shown that QoEdriven content
optimization leads to the optimal utilization of the networkReference In  a unique technique of the modelbased Rapproach is applied to improve bandwidth availability and
hence throughput performance of a network The MRmodel is embedded in a node that creates a model of the
operating environment and uses it to generate virtual states
and rewards for the virtual actions taken As the agent does
not need to wait for the real states and rewards from the
operating environment it can explore various kinds of actions
on the virtual operating environment within a short period
of time which helps to expedite the learning process and
hence the convergence rate to the optimal action In 
a MARL approach is applied in which nodes exchange
Qvalues among themselves and select their respective next
hop nodes with the best possible channel conditions while
forwarding packets towards the destination This helps to
improve throughput performance as nodes in a network
ensure that packets are successfully sent to the destination in
a collaborative manner2 TCP OPTIMIZATION
Transmission Control Protocol TCP is the core endtoend
protocol in TCPIP stack that provides reliable ordered and
errorfree delivery of messages between two communicating
hosts Due to the fact that TCP provides reliable and inorder
delivery congestion control is one of the major concerns of
this protocol which is commonly dealt with the algorithms
dened in RFC 5681 However classical congestion controalgorithms are suboptimal in hybrid wiredwireless networks
as they react to packet loss in the same manner in all net
work situations In order to overcome this shortcoming of
classical TCP congestion control algorithms an MLbased
approach is proposed in  which employs a supervised
classier based on features learned for classifying a packet
loss due to congestion or link errors Other approaches to
this problem currently employed in literature include using
RL that uses fuzzy logic based reward evaluator based ongame theory  Another promising approach named
Remy  uses a modied model of Markov decision pro
cess based on three factors 1 prior knowledge about the
network 2 a trafc model based on user needs ie through
put and delay and 3 an objective function that is to be
maximized By this learning approach a customized best
suited congestion control scheme is produced specically for
that part of the network adapted to its unique requirementsHowever classifying packet losses using unsupervised learn
ing methods is still an open research problem and there is a
need for realtime adaptive congestion control mechanism for
multimodal hybrid networksFor more applications refer to Table 9 which classies
different various network optimization and operation works
on the basis of their network type and the unsupervised
learning technique usedD DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION  VISUALIZATION

highdimensional data which can then be visualized to aid
human insight seeking and decision making  A num

recent applications of unsupervised ML techniques in SDNs
SONs and IoTs1 SOFTWARE DEFINED NETWORKS
SDN is a disruptive new networking architecture that sim
plies network operating and managing tasks and provides
infrastructural support for novel innovations by making the
network programmable  In simple terms the idea of
programmable networks is to simply decouple the data for
warding plane and controldecision plane which is rather
tightly coupled in the current infrastructure The use of SDN
can also be seen in managing and optimizing networks as
network operators go through a lot of hassle to imple
ment highlevel security policies in term of distributed low
level system congurations thus SDN resolves this issue
by decoupling the planes and giving network operators bet
ter control and visibility over network enabling them to
make frequent changes to network state and providing sup
port for highlevel specication language for network con
trol  SDN is applicable in a wide variety of areas
ranging from enterprise networks data centers infrastructure
based wireless access networks optical networks to home
and small businesses each providing many future research
opportunities Unsupervised ML techniques are seeing a surging interest
in SDN community as can be seen by a spate of recent workA popular application of unsupervised ML techniques in
SDNs relates to the application of intrusion detection and mit
igation of security attacks  Another approach for detect
ing anomalies in a cloud environment using unsupervised
learning model has been proposed by 2 SELF ORGANIZING NETWORKS
SON is another new and popular research regime in network
ing SON is inspired by the biological system which worksin the selforganization and achieves the task by learning
from the surrounding environment As the connected net
work devices are growing exponentially and the communi
cation cell size has reduced to femtocells the property of
selforganization is becoming increasingly desirable Feasibility of SON application in the fth generation 5Gof wireless communication is studied in Application of different MLbased SON for heterogeneous
networks is considered in  this paper also describes
the unsupervised ANN and hidden Markov models tech
niques employed for better learning from the surroundings

Key lessons drawn from the review of unsupervised learning
in networking applications are summarized below1 A recommended and wellstudied method for unsu
pervised Internet trafc classication in literature is
data clustering combined with the latent representation
learning on trafc feature set by using autoencodersMinmax ensemble learning will help to increase the
efciency of unsupervised learning if required2 Semisupervised learning is also an appropriate method

explored properly in literature and can be a potentiaresearch direction4 The overwhelming growth in network trafc and
expected surge in trafc with the evolution of 5G and

network trafc is based on PCA and multidimensionascaling Autoencoders tSNE and manifold learning
are potential areas of research in terms of dimensional
ity reduction and visualizationIV FUTURE WORK SOME RESEARCH CHALLENGES

This section provides a discussion on some open directions
for future work and the relevant opportunities in applying
unsupervised ML in the eld of networkingA SIMPLIFIED NETWORK MANAGEMENT
While new network architectures such as SDN have been
proposed in recent years to simplify network management
network operators are still expected to know too much
and to correlate between what they know about how their
network is designed with the current networks condition
through their monitoring sources Operators who manage
these requirements by wrestling with complexity manu

ally will denitely welcome any respite that
get from semiautomated unsupervised machine learningAs highlighted in by  for ML to become pervasive in
networking the semantic gapwhich refers to the key
challenge of transferring ML results into actionable insights
and reports for the network operatormust be overcomeThis can facilitate a shift from a reactive interaction style
for network management where the network manager is
expected to check maps and graphs when things go wrong
to a proactive one where automated reports and noticationsare created for different services and network regions Ideally
this would be abstract yet informative such as Google Maps
Directions eg there is heavier trafc than usual on your
route as well as suggestions about possible actions This
could be coupled with an automated correlation of different
reports coming from different parts of the network This wirequire a move beyond mere notications and visualizations
to more substantial synthesis through which potential sources
of problems can be identied Another example relates to
making measurements more useroriented Most users would
be more interested in QoE instead of QoS ie how the
current condition of the network affects their applications and
services rather than just raw QoS metrics The development
of measurement objectives should be from a businesseyebaperspectiveand not only through presenting statistics gath
ered through various tools and protocols such as traceroute
ping BGP etc with the burden of putting the various pieces
of knowledge together being on the userB SEMISUPERVISED LEARNING FOR

Semisupervised learning lies between supervised and unsu
pervised learning The idea behind semisupervised learning
is to improve the learning ability by using unlabeled data
incorporation with a small set of labeled examples In com
puter networks semisupervised learning is partially used
in anomaly detection and trafc classication and has great
potential to be used with deep unsupervised learning archi
tectures like generative adversarial networks for improving
the state of the art in anomaly detection and trafc classi
cation Similarly user behavior learning for cybersecurity
can also be tackled in a semisupervised fashion A semi
supervised learning based anomaly detection approach is pre
sented in  The presented approach used large amounts
of unlabeled samples together with labeled samples to build
a better intrusion detection classier In particular a single
hidden layer feedforward NN has trained to output a
fuzzy membership vector The results show that using unla
beled samples help signicantly improve the classiers
performance In another work C TRANSFER LEARNING IN COMPUTER NETWORKS
Transfer learning is an emerging ML technique in which
knowledge learned from one problem is applied to a different
but related problem  Although it is often thought that
for ML algorithms the training and future data must be in
the same feature space and must have the same distribution
this is not necessarily the case in many realworld applica
tions In such cases it is desirable to have transfer learn
ing or knowledge transfer between the different task domainsTransfer learning has been successfully applied in computer
vision and NLP applications but its implementation for net
working has not been witnessedeven though in principle
this can be useful in networking as well due to the similarVOLUME 7nature of Internet trafc and enterprise network trafc in
many respects Reference D FEDERATED LEARNING IN COMPUTER NETWORKS
Federated learning is a collaborative ML technique which
does not make use of centralized training data and works
by distributing the processing on different machines Feder
ated learning is considered to be the next big thing in cloud
networks as they ensure the privacy of the user data and less
computation on the cloud to reduce the cost and energy System and method for network address management in the
federated cloud are presented in E GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS GANSIN COMPUTER NETWORKS
Adversarial networksbased on generative adversarial net
work GAN training originally proposed by Goodfellow
and colleagues at the University of Montreal have
recently emerged as a new technique using which machines
can be trained to predict outcomes by only the observing
the world without necessarily being provided labeled dataAn adversarial network has two NN models a generator
which is responsible for generating some type of data from
some random input and a discriminator which has the task of
distinguishing between input from the generator or a real data
set The two NNs optimize themselves together resulting in a
more realistic generation of data by the generator and a better
sense of what is plausible in the real world for the discrimina
tor Reference V PITFALLS AND CAVEATS OF USING UNSUPERVISED
ML IN NETWORKING
With the benets and intriguing results of unsupervised learn
ing there also exist many shortcomings that are not addressed
widely in the literature Some potential pitfalls and caveats
related to unsupervised learning are discussed nextA INAPPROPRIATE TECHNIQUE SELECTION
To start with the rst potential pitfall could be the selection
of technique Different unsupervised learning and predicting
techniques may have excellent results on some applications
while performing poorly on othersit is important to choose
the best technique for the task at hand Another reason could
be a poor selection of features or parameters on which basispredictions are madethus parameter optimization is also
important for unsupervised algorithmsB LACK OF INTERPRETABILITY OF SOME
UNSUPERVISED ML ALGORITHMS
Some unsupervised algorithms such as deep NNs operate as
a black box which makes it difcult to explain and interpret
the working of such models This makes the use of such
techniques unsuitable for applications in which interpretabil
ity is important As pointed out in  understandability
of the semantics of the decisions made by ML is especially
important for the operational success of ML in largescale
operational networks and its acceptance by operators net
work managers and users But prediction accuracy and sim
plicity are often in conict  As an example the greater
accuracy of NNs accrues from its complex nature in which
input variables are combined in a nonlinear fashion to build
a complicated hardtoexplain model with NNs it may not
be possible to get interpretability as well since they make
a tradeoff in which they sacrice interpretability to achieve
high accuracy There are various ongoing research efforts
that are focused on making techniques such as NNs less
opaque  Apart from the focus on NNs there is a gen
eral interest in making AI and ML more explainable and
interpretableeg the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency or DARPAs explainable AI project2 is aiming to
develop explainable AI models leveraging various design
options spanning the performancevsexplainability trade
off space that can explain the rationale of their decision
making so that users are able to appropriately trust these
models particularly for new envisioned control applications
in which optimization decisions are made autonomously by
algorithmsC LACK OF OPERATIONAL SUCCESS
OF ML IN NETWORKING
In literature researchers have noted that despite substantiaacademic research and practical applications of unsupervised
learning in other elds we see that there is a dearth of prac
tical applications of ML solutions in operational networks
particular for applications such as network intrusion detec
tion  which are challenging problems for a number of
reasons including 1 the very high cost of errors 2 the lack
of training data 3 the semantic gap between results and their
operational interpretation 4 enormous variability in input
data and nally 5 fundamental difculties in conducting
sound performance evaluations Even for other applications
the success of ML and its wide adoption in practical systems
at scale lags the success of ML solutions in many other
domainsD IGNORING SIMPLE NONMACHINELEARNING

One should also keep in mind a common pitfall that aca
demic researchers may suffer from which is not realizing that2 7FIGURE 8 Intuitively we expect the ML models performance to improve with more data but to
deteriorate in performance if the model becomes overly complex for the data Figure adapted from network operators may have simpler nonmachine learning
based solutions that may work as well as nave MLbased
solutions in practical settings Failure to examine the ground
realities of operational networks will undermine the effec
tiveness of MLbased solutions We should expect MLbased
solutions to augment and supplement rather than replace
other nonmachinelearning based solutionsat least for the
foreseeable futureE OVERFITTING
Another potential issue with unsupervised models is overt
ting it corresponds to a model representing the noise or ran
dom error rather than learning the actual pattern in dataWhile commonly associated with supervised ML the prob
lem of overtting lurks whenever we learn from data and
thus is applicable to unsupervised ML as well As illustrated
in Figure 8 ideally speaking we expect ML algorithms to
provide improved performance with more data but with
increasing model complexity performance starts to deterio
rate after a certain pointalthough it is possible to get poorer
results empirically with increasing data when working with
unoptimized outofthebox ML algorithms  According
to the Occam Razor principle the model complexity should
be commensurate with the amount of data available and with
overly complex models the ability to predict and generalize
diminishes Two major reasons for overtting could be the
overly large size of the learning model and fewer sample data
used for training purposes Generally data is divided into
two portions actual data and stochastic noise due to the
unavailability of labels or related information unsupervised
learning model can overt the data which causes issues in
testing and deployment phase Crossvalidation regulariza
tion and Chisquared testing are highly recommended for
designing or tweaking an unsupervised learning algorithm to
avoid overtting F DATA QUALITY ISSUES
It should be noted that all ML is data dependent and the per
formance of ML algorithms is affected largely by the nature
volume quality and representation of data In the case of
unsupervised ML data quality issues must be carefully con
sidered since any problem with the data quality will seriouslymar the performance of ML algorithms A potential prob
lem is that dataset may be imbalanced if the samples size
from one class is very much smaller or larger than the other
classes  In such imbalanced datasets the algorithm
must be careful not to ignore the rare class by assuming
it to be noise Although imbalanced datasets are more of a
nuisance for supervised learning techniques they may also
pose problems for unsupervised and semisupervised learn
ing techniquesG INACCURATE MODEL BUILDING
It is difcult to build accurate and generic models since
each model is optimized for certain kind of applicationsUnsupervised ML models should be applied after carefully
studying the application and the suitability of the algorithm in
such settings  For example we highlight certain issues
related to the unsupervised task of clustering 1 random
initialization in Kmeans is not recommended 2 number of
clusters is not known before the clustering operation as we do
not have labels 3 in the case of hierarchical clustering we do
not know when to stop and this can cause increase in the time
complexity of the process and 4 evaluating the clustering
result is very tricky since the ground truth is mostly unknownH MACHINE LEARNING IN

Many networking problems such as anomaly detection are
adversarial problems in which the malicious intruder is con
tinually trying to outwit the network administrators and the
tools used by the network administrators In such settings
machine learning that learns from historical data may not
perform due to clever crafting of attacks specically for
circumventing any schemes based on previous dataDue to these challenges pitfalls and weaknesses due
care must be exercised while using unsupervised and semi
supervised ML These pitfalls can be avoided in part by using
various best practices  such as endtoend learning
pipeline testing visualization of the learning algorithm regu
larization proper feature engineering dropout sanity checks
through human inspectionwhichever is appropriate for the
problems contextVOLUME 7VI CONCLUSIONS
We have provided a comprehensive survey of machine learn
ing tasks latest unsupervised learning techniques and trends
along with a detailed discussion of the applications of these
techniques in networking related tasks Despite the recent
wave of success of unsupervised learning there is a scarcity
of unsupervised learning literature for computer networking
applications which this survey aims to address The few
previously published survey papers differ from our work in
their focus scope and breadth we have written this paper
in a manner that carefully synthesizes the insights from these
survey papers while also providing contemporary coverage of
recent advances Due to the versatility and evolving nature of
computer networks it was impossible to cover each and every
application however an attempt has been made to cover athe major networking applications of unsupervised learning
and the relevant techniques We have also presented concise
future work and open research areas in the eld of network
ing which is related to unsupervised learning coupled with a
brief discussion of signicant pitfalls and challenges in using
unsupervised machine learning in networksACKNOWLEDGEMENT

eventsVPOST PROCESSING OF OTDR DATAA  Offset Compensation             Once  the  trace  is  acquired  it  needs  to  beconverted  in  final  presentable  form  by  performinglogarithmic  operation  on  the  OTDR  signal  Thelogarithmic operations are sensitive to any fixedDCoffset  added  to  the  signal  All  ADCs  have  someinherent  fixedDC  offset  which  is  defined  as  thedifference  between  the  ideal  least  significant  bitLSB transition to the actual transition point If theoffset is not properly removed the logged trace rollsup when the backscatter reaches the noise floor It isnecessary  to  remove  the  ADC  offset  before  postprocessing  After  the  offset  is  removed  the  finatrace  needs  to  be  analyzed  for  events  and  theirparameters  Offset  compensation  is  an  importanttask  in  post  processing  of  acquired  traces  as  itensures  offset  errors  removed  and  a  linear  tracedisplayB  Trace AnalysisThe purpose of the trace analysis step is tofind  different  reflective  and  nonreflective  eventsalong  the  fiber  and  to  measure  their  locations  andlosses  Nonreflective  events  are  of  two  typesnamely loss and gain For each nonreflective eventthe insertion loss is measured The accurate methodof  determining  the  nonreflective  event  is  to  findfour marker locations two before the event and twoafter the eventFor each nonreflective event the insertion lossIL needs to be measured The accurate method fordetermining the loss is to find four marker locationstwo before the event and two after the event Leastsquare  LS  fits  are  found  for  sections  of  fiberbetween each pair of markers as shown in figureNOCOCI 2013 ISBN 978146735822After the post processing algorithm the resultantdetected  events  are  shown  by  the

for Hyperspectral Image ClassificationMuhammad Ahmad  Usman Ghous Muhammad Usama and Manuel MazzaraAbstract Transformers have proven effective for hyperspec
tral image classification HSIC but often incorporate average
pooling that results in information loss This letter presents
WaveFormer a novel transformerbased approach that leverages
wavelet transforms for invertible downsampling This preserves
data integrity while enabling attention learning Specifically
WaveFormer unifies downsampling with wavelet transforms to
decompress feature maps without loss This provides an efficient
tradeoff between performance and computation Furthermore
the wavelet decomposition enhances the interaction between
structural and shape information in image patches and chan
nel maps To evaluate WaveFormer we conducted extensive
experiments on two benchmark hyperspectral datasets Our
results demonstrate that WaveFormer achieves stateoftheart
classification accuracy obtaining overall accuracies of 9566
and 9654 on the Pavia University and the University of
Houston datasets respectively By integrating wavelet transforms

DL techniques  DL particularly convolutional neuranetworks CNNs addresses challenges in handling multi

dependencies for spectrally similar classes Recurrent neuranetworks RNNs can model these dependencies but lack the
ability for simultaneous model training a vital consideration
for the extensive HSI data comprising numerous samples On the other hand transformers using selfattention mech

emerged as promising candidates ViTs use selfattention
to capture relationships in image sequences represented as
patches proving beneficial for modeling longrange depen

ViTs encounter challenges related to scale invariance and
texture features Their fixedsize input may hinder recognizing
objects at different scales and their emphasis on global context
may limit their effectiveness in extracting finegrained texture
details  In addition the extensive data requirements for
ViTs may pose challenges in scenarios where a large number
of training samples are not readily available for HSIC To address the aforementioned issuesthis letter pro

with a spatial resolution of M  N pixels The HSI data
cube X  RMN B is first divided into overlapping 3D
patches Each patch is centered at a spatial location  and covers a spatial extent of S  S pixels across all BbandsThe total number of 3D patches m extracted from X ie
X  RSSB is M  S 1N  S 1 A patch located at
  is denoted as P and spans spatially from S1to   S  12 in width and   S  12 to   S  1in height The labeling of these patches is determined by the
label assigned to the central pixel within each patch The
transformed patches as explained in Algorithm1 are then
processed by the baseline 3DCNN model Specifically the
activation value at spatial location x y z in the jth feature
map of the ith layer vxyz is computed asi jvxyz

feature map at the ith layer dl1 is the number of feature maps
in the l1th layer and wi j is the depth of the kernel for the
jth feature map at the ith layer 2 1 21 and 21 define
the width height and depth of the kernel respectively along

data X  This process results in the creation of two subbands
namely X L and X H  Subsequently the same lowpass filter

columns of the derived subbands X L and X H  This leads
X L H 
to the formation of four subbands in totaX H L and X H H  Each of these wavelet subbands can be
Xviewed as a downsampled version of the original input
They collectively preserve all the input details without any
loss of information The four wavelet subbands are createdX L L X L H  X H L and X H H  These feature maps are then
linearly transformed into downsampled keys K w  RmD
and values V w  RmD where m  M2  N denotes the total number of patches Multiheaded selfattention

represent the downsampled keys and values

collective output of selfattention learning for each head can be
understood as the incorporation of longrange contextualized
information from the input data Finally
the features are
fed into a fully connected layer for classification and the
softmax function is applied to generate the class probability
distributions from which the final groundtruth maps are gen
erated The WaveFormer captures the essence of the wavelet
for HSIC By integrating spatialspectral information through
attention mechanisms and linear projections WaveFormer can
effectively process the HSI cube with reduced computationacomplexity making it suitable for resourceconstrained envi

components and spatial features The subbands were then concatenated to generate a new 3D representation Locally contextualized feature maps were
produced through a 3D convolution to define spatial locality within this representation To incorporate longrange contextualized information these feature
