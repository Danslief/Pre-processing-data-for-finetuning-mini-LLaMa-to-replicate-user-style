Question: Here is the rewritten text in the style of the author answering the questions himself:

**Q: What are the simplest type of attacks that aim to limit or minimize the extent to which the maximum change for all pixels in adversarial examples is achieved?**

A: The simplest type of attacks are L0-norm-based attacks, which aim to limit or minimize the extent to which the maximum change for all pixels in adversarial examples is achieved. This constraint forces the attacker to only make very small changes to each pixel.

**=======**

**Q: How do L0-norm-based attacks work, and what constraints do they place on the attacker's "starting point"?**

A: L0-norm-based attacks work by minimizing the number of perturbed pixels in an image and forcing the modifications only to very few pixels. This means that the attacker's "starting point" is constrained to only introduce perturbations in a limited number of pixels.

**=======**

**Q: Why is it important to ensure imperceptibility of perturbations in developing an attack, and what constraints are placed on the attacker's "starting point" in this context?**

A: Imperceptibility of perturbations is important to ensure that the attacker's "starting point" is tightly constrained, allowing the attacker to only introduce small and subtle changes to the input sample. This ensures that the perturbations are not easily detectable by a human.

Answer: 

Question: Here are the answers with the requested format:

What is the constraint on the perturbation in the case of Preserving Perturbation?
=============================

The attacker does not have to select a starting point but it is given a draw from the data distribution and creates such perturbation as long as the original content of the sample is preserved.

What type of perturbed input sample can the attacker generate in the case of Non-suspicious Input?
=============================

The attacker can generate any type of desired perturbed input sample as long as it remains undetectable to a human.

What type of perturbed input sample can the attacker generate in the case of Content-Constrained Input?
=============================

The attacker can generate any type of desired perturbed input sample as long as it maintains some content payload, i.e., it must be a picture of a dog but not necessarily a particular dog. This includes payload-constrained input, where human perception might not be important. Rather, the intended function of the input example remains intact.

What type of perturbed input sample can the attacker generate in the case of Unconstrained Input?
=============================

There is no constraint on the input and an attacker can produce any type of input example to get the desired output or behavior from the system.

**Q1: What are the two broad categories of defenses against adversarial attacks?**
**A1:** In the literature, defenses against adversarial attacks have been divided into two broad categories: (1) reactive, which involves detecting adversarial observations (input) after deep models are trained; and (2) proactive, which makes the deep model robust against adversarial examples before the attack. =======

**Q2: How can these techniques be broadly divided?**
**A2:** Alternatively, these techniques can also be broadly divided into three categories: (1) modifying data; (2) adding auxiliary models; and (3) modifying models.

[184] used generative models to clean the adversarial perturbations from malicious images and then gave the cleaned images to the non-modified ML model. This approach ascertains that regardless of the attack type and targeted model, the adversarial examples lie in the low probability regions of the training data distribution.

**Q2: What are some methods that modify the parameters/features learned by the trained model?**
**A2:** The methods that fall in this category mainly modify the parameters/features learned by the trained model. For example, defensive distillation is a method that modifies the parameters learned by the trained model. Papernot et al. [187] adopted network distillation as a procedure to defend against adversarial attacks and presented a defense method known as defensive distillation. The notion of distillation was originally proposed by Hinton et al. [188] as a mechanism for effectively transferring knowledge from a larger network to a smaller one. The defense method developed by Papernot et al. is based on the idea of distillation, where the knowledge learned by a large, complex model is transferred to a smaller, simpler model. This can help to improve the robustness of the smaller model against adversarial attacks. =======

This makes adversarial examples with small perturbations unlikely to modify the output of deep models, but increases training complexity by a factor of two.

=======

Question: Here are the question-answer pairs with the author's style:

**Q1: What are the recommended evaluation methods for adversarial robustness?**
**A1:** To avoid unintended consequences and pitfalls of evaluation methods, I recommend using both targeted and untargeted attacks. This is crucial to ensure that the model's robustness is thoroughly evaluated.

=======

**Q2: Why is it important to use both targeted and untargeted attacks?**
**A2:** Using both targeted and untargeted attacks is important because they test different aspects of the model's robustness. Targeted attacks aim to manipulate the model's predictions by maximizing the confidence of a specific class, while untargeted attacks aim to minimize the confidence of the correct label. By evaluating both types of attacks, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the model's robustness.

=======

**Q3: What is the difference between targeted and untargeted attacks?**
**A3:** Theoretically, untargeted attacks are considered to be strictly easier than targeted attacks. However, in practice, untargeted attacks can be more effective in certain situations. Many untargeted attacks work by minimizing the prediction confidence of the correct label, whereas targeted attacks work by maximizing the prediction confidence of some other class.

=======

**Q4: Why is ablation analysis important for evaluating adversarial robustness?**
**A4:** Ablation analysis is important because it allows us to understand how different defense components contribute to the model's robustness. By removing a combination of defense components and verifying that the attack succeeds on a similar but undefended model, we can develop a straightforward understanding of the model's vulnerabilities and strengths.

Answer: 

Question: Here are the question-answer pairs with the author's style:

**Q1: What are the key goals of evaluating the robustness of a model?**
A1: The primary goals of evaluating the robustness of a model are to assess the effectiveness of combining multiple defense strategies for robustifying the model, and to evaluate the model's performance in diverse test settings.

=======

**Q2: How can we perform the evaluation in diverse test settings?**
A2: To perform the evaluation in diverse test settings, we should test the robustness to random noise, validate broader threat models, and carefully evaluate the attack hyper-parameters and select those that provide the best performance. Additionally, we should verify that the attack converges under selected hyperparameters, and investigate whether attack results are sensitive to a specific set of hyperparameters. It's also important to experiment with at least one hard label attack and one gradient-free attack.

=======

**Q3: Why is it important to evaluate the defense on broader domains?**
A3: For a defense to be truly effective, it's crucial to evaluate the proposed defense method on broader domains other than images. The majority of works on adversarial machine learning mainly investigate the imaging domain, so it's essential to state explicitly that the defense has been tested on other domains as well.
Answer: 

Question: Here are the question-answer pairs with the author's style:

**Question 1:** What is the limitation of a defense mechanism that can only defend against adversarial perturbations in a specific domain?

=======

**Question 2:** How can we create adversarial examples to test the robustness of a defense mechanism?

**Answer:** It is important to create adversarial examples by ensembling over the randomness of those defenses that randomize aspects of DNN inference. This introduces stochasticity and makes standard attacks harder to realize. We should also verify that the attack remains successful when randomness is assigned a fixed value.

=======

**Question 3:** What is the threat model for an attack on a defense mechanism, and what knowledge about randomness is available to the adversary?

**Question 4:** How can we test the transferability of an attack on a defense mechanism?

**Answer:** We can select a similar substitute model (to the defended model) and perform transferability of the attack. Since adversarial examples are often transferable across different models, an adversarial sample constructed for one model often appears adversarial to another model with identical architecture, regardless of the fact that the other model is trained on a completely different data distribution.

g) Upper bound of robustness
Q: How can we provide an upper bound on robustness?
A: To provide an upper bound on robustness, we can apply adaptive attacks, which give access to a full defense. This means we use the strongest attack for a given threat model and defense being evaluated. We should also verify that adaptive attacks perform better than others and evaluate their performance in multiple settings, such as the combination of transfer, random-noise, and black-box attacks. For instance, Ruan et al. evaluated the robustness of DNN and presented an approximate approach to provide lower and upper bounds on robustness for L0 norm with provable guarantees [217].

**Q1:** How does the distributed nature of data in connected vehicles affect the applicability of ML/DL models?
**A1:** The data is generated and stored in a distributed fashion, which raises a question about the applicability of ML/DL models at a global level. ML models are typically developed with the assumption that data is easily accessible and managed by a central entity, but this is not the case in connected vehicles.
