Question: Here are the question-answer pairs with the author's style:

**Q1:** How do jammers affect cell-level KPIs?
**A1:** Jammers can significantly impact three cell-level KPIs: UL/DL traffic volumes, UL/DL throughputs, and uplink RSSI. As shown in Fig. 1, the presence of a jammer can lead to a substantial decrease in these KPIs. =======

**Q2:** How do jammers behave, and what are the challenges in modeling their behavior?
**A2:** Jammers can exhibit diverse behaviors, including continuous or discontinuous activation patterns. They can also differ in their type, target networks, and frequency bands. In our real-world dataset, we have encountered jammers that can affect up to ten different frequency bands. Moreover, new types of jammers with unknown characteristics can emerge over time, making it challenging to model their behavior. =======

**Q3:** How can we disambiguate jammer-related activity from normal network KPI dynamics?
**A3:** Disambiguating jammer-related activity from normal network KPI dynamics can be challenging, especially when considering factors like user mobility and network overload.

Question: Here are the question-answer pairs with the author's style:

**Q1:** What are the two methods used by JADE to detect jammer activation?
**A1:** JADE uses two methods to detect jammer activation. The first method compares the predicted and actual values of KPIs, and if the actual value is more than a threshold, it is considered as jammer activation. The second method uses a LSTM autoencoder model to model multivariate KPI time series and compares the reconstruction error over time with a threshold to detect jammer activation. =======

**Q2:** How does JADE address the challenges of limited labeled data and detecting new and unknown jammer activity?
**A2:** JADE operates in a semi-supervised anomaly detection mode, relying only on normal data for training the models. This approach allows JADE to detect new and unknown jammer activity without requiring labeled data. Additionally, JADE's jammer-agnostic nature makes it robust to detecting jammers that may exhibit adversarial behaviors. =======

**Q3:** How does JADE adapt to changing thresholds to detect anomalies?
**A3:** JADE embeds a mechanism to adaptively set thresholds to detect anomalies, which allows it to adjust the boundary between normal and abnormal events. This adaptive thresholding mechanism enables JADE to effectively detect jammers in real-world mobile networks. =======

**Q4:** How does JADE support the detection of jammers at scale in real-world mobile networks?
**A4:** JADE is designed to efficiently support the detection of jammers at scale in real-world mobile networks across multiple cells and operating frequency bands.

Answer: 

Question: Here are the question-answer pairs with the author's style:

**Q1: What is the main goal of an effective jammer detection method?**
**A1:** The main goal of an effective jammer detection method is to minimize both false positives (FPs) and false negatives (FNs). This means detecting jammer activity accurately and avoiding unnecessary false alarms.

=======

**Q2: What are the two commonly used measures to assess the effectiveness of a jammer detection method?**
**A2:** The two commonly used measures are Precision and Recall. Precision measures the proportion of true positives (TPs) among all predicted positives, while Recall measures the proportion of TPs among all actual positives.

=======

**Q3: What is the significance of Precision in jammer detection?**
**A3:** A lower value of Precision (equivalently, a higher number of FPs) leads to an increase in OPEX to diagnose, confirm, and localize jammer activity, even when there is no actual jammer activity. This is undesirable.

=======

**Q4: What is the significance of Recall in jammer detection?**
**A4:** A lower value of Recall (equivalently, a high number of FNs) shows that the method fails to detect all jammer activation events, risking prolonged degradation of user QoE until the jammer activity is eventually detected and stopped.

=======

**Q5: Why are both Precision and Recall important in jammer detection?**
**A5:** Both Precision and Recall are equally important because high Precision ensures accurate detection, while high Recall ensures that all jammer activation events are detected. Having high values for both metrics is crucial for effective jammer detection.

=======

**Q6: What is the composite metric used to evaluate the effectiveness of a jammer detection method?**
**A6:** We consider a composite metric called F1-Score, which combines Precision and Recall to provide a single metric that balances both aspects.
Answer: 

Question: Here are the question-answer pairs with the author's style:

**Q1: What is the F1-score and how is it calculated?**
F1-score is a measure of the model's accuracy, and it weighs precision and recall equally by taking a harmonic mean of the two. The formula is: F1-Score = 2 \* (Precision \* Recall) / (Precision + Recall).

=======

=======

**Q: Why does the percentage of VoLTE drops have the least predictive effect on the classifier?**
**A:** Interestingly, the percentage of VoLTE drops has the least predictive effect on the classifier, perhaps because call drops could happen due to a myriad of factors beyond the jammer presence, such as network overload or coverage issues.

=======

**Q: What are the precision, recall, and F1-score metrics for each frequency band where the J16 jammer operates?**
**A:** Fig. 3 shows the box plot results for precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, separately for each frequency band where the J16 jammer operates. We observe that precision and recall values are less than ideal, and range between 0.7-0.8 and 0.55-0.75, respectively.

=======

**Q3:** Why do supervised classifiers fail to take advantage of available data?
**A3:** Supervised classifiers fail to take advantage of available data because it is difficult to produce a large and diverse labeled dataset with "jammer activation" events, whereas more data is available for "normal" periods.

=======

**Q4:** What is the limitation of supervised classification-based approach to jammer detection?
**A4:** The limitation is that it is difficult to produce a large and diverse labeled dataset with "jammer activation" events, which highlights the need for more and diverse "labeled" data.

**Q: Are the anomaly detection models developed by JADE cell-level or frequency band-specific?**
**A:** No, JADE employs transfer learning towards a one-cell and frequency band agnostic model, which means the anomaly detection models are not specific to a particular cell or frequency band.

=======

**Q: What are the two anomaly detection models developed by JADE for jammer activity detection?**

Question: Here are the question-answer pairs with the author's style:

**Q1: What is the formula for G_calc?**
A1: The formula for G_calc is given by: G_calc = (N-1)√(Ns / (tα/(2N),N-2)2) + (t α/(2N),N-2)2, where N is the number of training error samples considered initially, t refers to the t-distribution, and α is the significance level (related to the desired confidence interval).

=======

**Q2: What does G_calc represent?**
A2: G_calc represents a statistical measure used to detect outliers in a set of N samples. If G_calc is less than or equal to the critical value, we conclude that there is no outlier in the set of N samples.

=======

**Q3: How is the bootstrap process used in anomaly detection?**
A3: We bootstrap the above statistic calculation with a series of N error samples (ϵ) from the training data and view it as a window. Then, when we apply an anomaly detection model to each new sample in the radio network KPI time series for a cell, we slide the window and include the new error sample ϵnew to recalculate the statistic.

=======

**Q4: What happens if the new error sample ϵnew is greater than the critical value?**
A4: If ϵnew is greater than the critical value, the new error sample corresponds to an outlier (anomaly) and so we undo the window sliding to ignore ϵnew. Otherwise, ϵnew is now part of the set of error samples considered for outlier detection.
