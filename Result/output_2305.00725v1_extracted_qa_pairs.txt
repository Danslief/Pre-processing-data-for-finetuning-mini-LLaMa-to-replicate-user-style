Question: Here's a question-answer pair based on the text:

**Q: Why did the model overfit and what was done to mitigate it?**
**A:** The model would overfit, resulting in a high train and low test accuracy. This high bias could be attributed to small dataset sizes. To mitigate this problem of high bias, we added augmentations to our training data. These augmentations were composed of stretching and contracting audio samples, adding a low-amplitude Gaussian noise, and randomly masking the time and frequency axes of the computed melspectrograms. This augmentation scheme proved helpful in terms of model generalisability and training.

Question: Here are the question-answer pairs with the author's style:

**Q1: What is the main focus of the research?**
**A1:** The main focus of our research is on scream detection and emotion detection, specifically separating scream utterances from non-scream ones and classifying whether a person's scream is in a situation of danger or duress.

=======

**Q2: Why is it important to cluster screams in positive and negative categories?**
**A2:** It is important to cluster screams in positive and negative categories so that the user can be notified of the type of scream detected by the system. This way, the user can take appropriate action, such as investigating a scream that indicates danger or duress.

=======

**Q3: What model is used for comparison in the experiments?**
**A3:** We compare our results with a MobileNetV3-small model, which is a popular choice for edge computing. For brevity, we refer to it as MobileNetV3s in the proceeding sections.

Question: Here's a Q&A pair based on the text:

**Q:** Why does the model struggle to cluster utterances into positive and negative categories?
**A:** The model struggles to cluster utterances into positive and negative categories because there is little to no clustering within the raw melspectrograms.

Question: Here are the question-answer pairs with the author's style:

**Q1:** What are the primary concerns when deploying models in production?
**A1:** The primary concerns are the total time to load the model and the time it takes for a single forward pass of an utterance.

=======

**Q2:** How do the teacher, student, and MobileNetV3s models compare in terms of latency?
**A2:** The student model is almost twice as fast as the teacher model and is about 20ms faster than the MobileNetV3s model.

Question: Here are the question-answer pairs with the author's style:

**Q1:** Why is there no clustering on raw Mel-spectrograms?
**A1:** That's correct, we didn't observe any clustering on raw Mel-spectrograms. However, the t-SNE plots after using the trained models show samples getting clustered, which is an interesting observation.

=======

**Q2:** How does the number of parameters in a model affect its performance?
**A2:** A larger number of parameters in a model increases the computational cost, and similarly, a large memory footprint contributes to higher model loading times. This is an important consideration when deploying our system on devices with limited resources.
