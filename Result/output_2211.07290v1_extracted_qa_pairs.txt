Question: Here are the question-answer pairs with the author's style:

**Q1:** What does it mean when someone is happy?
**A1:** Someone is happy. However, this might not always be true. For instance, in the US and many other parts of the world [59], it is common to smile at strangers, which might not represent inner feelings or states. It follows that more contextual details are required to understand the emotion, potentially requiring more data and invasive practices. =======

**Q2:** What are some problems that AI technology faces?
**A2:** Some findings indicate that AI technology suffers from problems such as sexism, racism, and other forms of discrimination [60]. A major aspect related to this arises from homogeneous or unrepresentative data. Another reason could be focusing on the majority class since optimizing for the majority class will usually improve overall accuracy. Unfortunately, this translates into discrimination against the minority classes as AI models typically do not automatically provide fairness unless constraints are placed for ensuring fairness (in which case, the overall accuracy will usually reduce as fairness also decreases). =======
Answer: 

Question: Here are the question-answer pairs with the author's style:

**Q1:** What are the differences between accuracy and inclusivity in AI?
**A1:** Accuracy and inclusivity are different objectives, and it is not uncommon for them to have tradeoffs. In other words, striving for one may sometimes come at the expense of the other. (=======)

**Q2:** Why is it important to make AI more inclusive?
**A2:** If we don't work to make AI more inclusive, we risk creating machine intelligence that "mirrors a narrow and privileged vision of society, with its old, familiar biases and stereotypes" (Kate Crawford, New York Times). (=======)

**Q3:** What is the role of decolonial theory in AI development?
**A3:** Experts are now calling out for using decolonial theory as a tool for sociotechnical foresight in AI to ensure that the hegemony resulting from the domination of the AI industry by a limited number of demographic groups and nations does not have harmful effects globally. (=======)

**Q4:** What is AER technology, and what are its implications?
**A4:** Giving emotions to a computer is another term for AER technology. It is exciting and a pipe dream to have a human-like or superior emotion detection system. In the last decade, techniques based on advanced techniques in ML and deep learning have outperformed almost all classical methods in recognizing and understanding human emotions from various sources, including text, speech, and facial expressions. (=======)
