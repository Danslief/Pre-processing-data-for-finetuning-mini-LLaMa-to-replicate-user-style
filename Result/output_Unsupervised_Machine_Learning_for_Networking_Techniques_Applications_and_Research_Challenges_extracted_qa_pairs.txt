Question: Here are the question-answer pairs with the author's style:

**Q1:** What is the mechanism of lateral inhibition in ART models?
**A1:** Ah, great question! In ART models, lateral inhibition refers to the process of competition between neurons. Once the winning neuron is selected after a competition with the best match to the input vector, the reset module compares the quality of the match to the vigilance threshold. If the winning neuron is within the threshold, it is selected as the output, else the winning neuron is reset and the process is started again to find the next best match to the input vector. =======

**Q2:** How do ART models handle the plasticity/stability dilemma?
**A2:** Ah, excellent question! ART models are self-organizing, which means they can deal with the plasticity/stability dilemma. In case where no neuron is capable to pass the threshold test, a search procedure begins in which the reset module disables recognition neurons one at a time to find a correct match whose weight can be adjusted to accommodate the new match. This way, ART models can adapt to new information while maintaining stability. =======

Question: Here are the question-answer pairs with the author's style:

**Q1: What is the critical information in the data that needs to be considered when selecting the number of principal components?**
The choice of the number of principal components is a question of the design decision. Much research has been conducted on selecting the number of components such as cross-validation approximations [98].

**=======**

**Q2: How is the optimal number of principal components chosen?**
Optimally, k is chosen such that the ratio of the average squared projection error to the total variation in the data is less than or equal to 1% by which 99% of the variance is retained in the k principal components.

**Q1:** How do we model parameters in CRNs when they are not directly observable?

An HMM-based approach can analytically model a Markovian stochastic process in which we do not have access to the actual states, which are assumed to be unobserved or hidden; instead, we can observe a state that is stochastically dependent on the hidden state. It is for this reason that an HMM is defined to be a doubly stochastic process. =======

This is computationally expensive, but it allows us to use complicated models with a small dataset and still avoid overfitting. Posterior probabilities are calculated by dividing the product of the sampling distribution and prior distribution by the marginal likelihood; in simple words, posterior probabilities are the result of combining our prior knowledge with the data. =======

=======

QoS (Quality of Service) and QoE (Quality of Experience) are two crucial measures of service performance and end-user experience, respectively. While QoS focuses on the quantitative performance as seen by the user, QoE is a qualitative measure of subjective metrics experienced by the user. In the context of Internet services, especially multimedia content delivery services, QoS/QoE optimization is essential to maximize the user experience. The dynamic and bursty nature of Internet traffic requires computer networks to adapt to these changes without compromising end-user experiences. As QoE is subjective, it heavily relies on the underlying QoS, which is affected by various network parameters.

**Q2: What is the concept of generative adversarial networks (GANS) in computer networks?**
**A2:** Ah, GANS! It's a fascinating topic. Generative adversarial networks, or GANS, are a type of neural network that uses a technique called generative adversarial network training, originally proposed by Goodfellow and colleagues at the University of Montreal [312]. Essentially, GANS allow machines to predict outcomes by observing the world without being provided labeled data. It's a two-player game between a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates data from random input, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between generated data and real data. Through this adversarial process, the generator becomes more realistic, and the discriminator becomes better at distinguishing between real and generated data.
