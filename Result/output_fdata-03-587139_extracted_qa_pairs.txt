What are the well-known attacks on cloud-hosted ML/DL models?

Cloud-hosted ML/DL models are vulnerable to various types of attacks, including data poisoning, model inversion, model stealing, and backdoor attacks. Data poisoning attacks involve injecting malicious data into the training dataset to manipulate the model's behavior. Model inversion attacks involve reconstructing the training data from the model's predictions. Model stealing attacks involve stealing the trained model and retraining it on a new dataset. Backdoor attacks involve inserting a backdoor into the model, allowing an attacker to manipulate its behavior.

To counter these attacks, several countermeasures and defenses can be employed. These include using secure communication protocols, implementing access controls and authentication mechanisms, and regularly updating and patching the models. Additionally, techniques such as model monitoring, anomaly detection, and explainability methods can be used to detect and prevent attacks.

**Question:** Why was Liang et al. (2016) not included in the analysis?

**Answer:** Liang et al. (2016) investigated the security challenges for client-side classifiers via a case study on Google's phishing pages filter.

=======

**Question:** Why was Demetrio et al. (2020) not included in the analysis?

**Answer:** Demetrio et al. (2020) presented WAF-A-MoLE, a tool that models the presence of an adversary. Their work demonstrated that ML-based WAFs are exposed to a concrete risk of being bypassed. However, their attack is not associated with any cloud-based services, which is the primary focus of our analysis.

=======

**Question:** Why was Apruzzese et al. (2019) not included in the analysis?

**Answer:** Apruzzese et al. (2019) discussed adversarial attacks where the machine learning model is compromised to induce an output favorable to the attacker. While their work is relevant to the field of machine learning security, their attacks are not specifically targeted at cloud-based services, which is the primary focus of our analysis.
