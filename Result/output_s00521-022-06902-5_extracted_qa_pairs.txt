Answer: 

Question: Here is the rewritten text in the style of the author answering the questions himself:

**Q: How do you train the proposed network?**
**A:** We train the proposed network for 24 epochs for all the training sets. Having large training data helped the model converge quickly. After that, we select the best model based on the validation set. While training each stream, we use data augmentation techniques like Gaussian blur and JPEG compression with a 10% probability.

**=======**

**Q: What evaluation metrics do you use?**
**A:** We use two main evaluation metrics: F1-Score and Accuracy. The F1-Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, calculated as F1 = 2/(1/precision + 1/recall). Precision is the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives, while recall is the number of true positive results divided by the total number of samples that should have been identified as positive. Accuracy, on the other hand, is defined as the ratio of correct predictions over the total number of predictions made, calculated as Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN), where TP, FP, TN, and FN represent the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, respectively.

Question: Here's a question-answer pair to help fine-tune a model:

**Q: How do you combine DWT and DFT for better feature representation and robust fake content detection?**
**A:** To combine DWT and DFT, we propose a two-stream network architecture that leverages the strengths of both transformations. The DWT stream is used to extract spatial features, while the DFT stream is used to extract frequency features. The outputs from both streams are then concatenated and fed into a fully connected layer to generate the final feature representation. This combination allows us to capture both spatial and frequency domain information, leading to more robust feature representation and improved fake content detection.
