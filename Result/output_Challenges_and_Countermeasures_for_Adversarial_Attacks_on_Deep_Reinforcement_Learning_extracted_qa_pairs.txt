Question: Here are the question-answer pairs with the author's style:

**1. What is an MDP in terms of the state, action, reward, and dynamics of the system?**

An MDP is a mathematical framework that models decision-making in situations where outcomes are partially random and partially under the control of the decision maker. In an MDP, the state, action, reward, and dynamics of the system are the key components. At each time step, the agent observes the current state, performs an action based on its current policy, and receives a reward. The goal is to find the best actions that maximize the long-term expected reward.

=======

**2. What is the environment in an MDP, and how is it categorized?**

The environment is a simulator or a real-world scenario in which the agent interacts and learns. At each time step, the agent (governed by the policy) interacts with the environment and receives a reward. The environment can be categorized into two types: partially observable and fully observable. In a partially observable environment, the agent can only partially observe the environment, and POMDPs (Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes) are used to model this type of environment. In a fully observable environment, the agent has complete knowledge of the environment, and traditional MDPs can be used.
Answer: 

Question: Here are the question-answer pairs with the author's style:

**Q1:** What type of MDPs are used when the agent can observe all states?
**A1:** MDPs are used when the agent can observe all states, and we use MDPs for this. MDPs are a special case of POMDPs, where the observation function is identity. =======

**Q2:** What is the role of an action in a DRL problem?
**A2:** The action is a stimulus used by the agent for interactions with the environment. The actions can be discrete or continuous based on the environment and DRL problem formulation. =======

**Q3:** What is the purpose of a reward in a DRL problem?
**A3:** The reward is an incentive, expressed by a numerical value, that the agent receives after making an action. The goal of an agent is to maximize the accumulated reward. To reduce the impact of the reward which the agent might get in a later state due to taking a specific action in the current state, the notion of discounted rewards was introduced. It is usually denoted by γ and can take any value ranging from 0 to 1. Mathematically, the discounted reward Rt is given as Rt = T/summationdisplay t' = t γt' - tr(st') (1) where t denotes the time step, T is the final time step, r denotes the reward for the time step, and st denotes the current state. =======

Answer: 

Question: Here are the question-answer pairs with the author's style:

**1. What is the value of a state?**

=======

**2. What is the Q-function?**
Q-function specifies the Q-value of a state. Q-value is defined as the maximum expected discounted reward an agent may get by taking a specific action at a specific state. Mathematically, it can be calculated as follows Qπ(s)=Eπ[Rt|s=st,a=at] (3) where π is the policy, Rt is the discounted reward, st is the current state, and at is the current action.

Question: Here are the question-answer pairs with the author's style:

**8) What is a policy in reinforcement learning?**
A policy defines how the agent will behave in the environment at a particular time. It's a mapping from the perceived states of the environment to the actions taken in those conditions. A policy is said to be optimal if it achieves the maximum possible reward at each state.

=======

**9) What are on-policy algorithms in reinforcement learning?**
On-policy algorithms enable an agent to learn and update its policy in an online manner through real-time interaction with the environment. Samples generated from the current policy are used to train the algorithm to estimate the policy in advance.

=======

**10) What are off-policy algorithms in reinforcement learning?**
Off-policy algorithms use an online policy and a target policy.
Answer: 

Question: Here are the question-answer pairs with the author's style:

**11) What is the role of the target policy in Deep Reinforcement Learning?**

The target policy is used to estimate the action values, while the online policy is being learned. Hence, the agent can estimate the target policy without its complete knowledge. =======

**12) What is the concept of exploration and exploitation in Deep Reinforcement Learning?**

Exploration and exploitation are two fundamental concepts in Deep Reinforcement Learning. Exploration is the process when the agent tries to explore the surrounding environment by taking different actions available at a given state. Exploitation occurs after exploration. The agent exploits the optimal actions to achieve the maximum cumulative reward. An epsilon-greedy policy is used to balance exploration and exploitation. The agent chooses a random action with a certain probability; otherwise, it takes the action followed by the policy. The probability of the random action being taken keeps decreasing over time. =======

=======

**Q5:** What is the goal of inference phase attacks in ML?
**A5:** Inference phase attacks are performed by the adversary at the inference/test time of the ML pipeline to fool the model/policy in providing malfunctioned results/actions.

The second type is misclassification attacks, where the attacker seeks to disturb the classification boundary of any class to cause misclassification.

The advantage of using static reward impact maps is that it allows the adversary to choose which features to perturb to maximize the impact on the reward, making it more effective in generating perturbations for untargeted attacks.

=======

**Q5: How do static reward impact maps help in generating perturbations for untargeted attacks?**
Static reward impact maps help in generating perturbations for untargeted attacks by allowing the adversary to identify which features have a large impact on the reward and perturb them accordingly, making it more effective in misguiding the agent.

Lin et al. [44] show the vulnerability of c-MARL agents to adversarial attacks by proposing a mechanism of adding perturbations to the state space.

=======

**Q5: What are some challenges in attacking c-MARL environments?**
Difficulty to estimate team rewards, difficulty to measure the effect of misprediction of an agent on the team reward; nondifferentiability of models, and low-dimensionality of the feature space make attacking such environments challenging.

=======

**Q6: Why are c-MARL agents more vulnerable to adversarial attacks?**

Question: Here is the rewritten text in the style of the author answering the questions himself:

Q: How can an adversary perturb the training data to indirectly make the agent follow a targeted policy?
A: An adversary can create and hide deficiencies in the policy to use them later for their benefit. For instance, Kiourti et al.

=======

Q: What is the impact of this Trojan attack on the DRL model?
A: The attack can induce hidden behaviors in the policy that make the model perform perfectly well until the Trojan is triggered. In fact, it's reported that by modifying only 0.025% of the training data, an adversary can achieve this.

=======

Q: Are there any defense techniques that can resist this Trojan attack?
A: Unfortunately, the proposed attack is shown to be resistant against current defense techniques for Trojans.

=======

**Q2: What is the goal of the adversary in the state manipulation attack?**
**A2:** The goal of the adversary in the state manipulation attack is to change the label of one compromised node to be uncompromised and vice versa. This is done by changing the binary reward of two states from 0 to 1 and 1 to 0, respectively.

=======

**Q3: How does the approach of Huang and Zhu differ from the one proposed in the paper?**

=======
