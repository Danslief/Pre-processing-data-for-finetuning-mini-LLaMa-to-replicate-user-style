=======

**Q2: What is the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)?**
The Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) is a method proposed by Goodfellow et al. [12] for generating adversarial examples. It exploits the vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial perturbations by performing one step gradient update along the sign of the gradient to solve the optimization problem. The perturbation is calculated as =sign(rxj(x;l)) (1), where  represents the update step width or magnitude of the perturbation.

=======

=======

**Q3:** How does the JSMA attack calculate the saliency map?
**A3:** The JSMA attack calculates the saliency map by calculating the Jacobian of the forward propagating examples with respect to the input sample, denoted as J(x) = @f(x) / @x. This is done by calculating the partial derivative of each feature fj(x) with respect to the input xi, denoted as [@fj(x) / @(xi)].

=======

**Q4:** How effective is the JSMA attack?
**A4:** The JSMA attack achieved 97% accuracy by altering only 42% of the input features. Although it provides very effective adversarial examples, it is computationally very expensive [31].

Question: Here are the answers to the questions, formatted as you requested:

=====


Question 1: Since ML/DL techniques are necessary to fuel the CSON, do these techniques provide the necessary robustness required to deal with adversarial perturbations?

Answer: Unfortunately, our experiments show that ML/DL techniques, although powerful, are not inherently robust against adversarial perturbations. In fact, we found that even state-of-the-art CNN architectures can be easily fooled by carefully crafted adversarial examples. This highlights the need for additional techniques to enhance the robustness of ML/DL-based malware classifiers.

=====


Question 2: How to build deterrence against adversarial attacks in CSON?

Answer: To build deterrence against adversarial attacks, we propose a multi-faceted approach that combines both defensive and offensive strategies. On the defensive side, we employ techniques such as input preprocessing, regularization, and ensemble methods to reduce the impact of adversarial attacks. On the offensive side, we develop novel adversarial attacks that can evade state-of-the-art defenses, thereby creating an arms race between adversaries and defenders.

=====


Question 3: Do the deterrence techniques against adversarial examples create an arms race between adversaries?

Answer: Yes, our experiments suggest that the deterrence techniques we propose can indeed create an arms race between adversaries. As defenders develop new defenses, adversaries will respond by creating more sophisticated attacks. This arms race can be seen as a cat-and-mouse game, where each side tries to outsmart the other. However, we believe that this arms race can be beneficial, as it drives innovation and improvement in both defense and attack techniques.

Answer: 

Question: Here are the question-answer pairs with the author's style:

**Q1:** What is the significance of robustness in ML/DL models in the context of CSON?
**A1:** The robustness of ML/DL models is an integral part of the security architecture of CSON, and we demonstrated that a small perturbation in the test example has the potential to evade the integrity of the classifier. This performance degradation depicts the potential risks of applying ML/DL methods in the context of CSON without considering the robustness of ML/DL classifiers and building proper deterrence against adversarial examples. Without such deterrence, ML/DL models might cause more harm than good in CSON.

=======

**Q2:** What is the computational complexity of detecting and exploiting errors in ML/DL techniques?
**A2:** Adversarial attacks are not just random noise/values added to the test samples. Instead, they are carefully calculated perturbations. These perturbations are based on exploiting the inherent generalization error and gradient variations in ML/DL techniques. As shown in Table IV, detecting and exploiting these errors to make effective adversarial examples is a computationally very complex and expensive process. Since JSMA works on saliency maps and forward derivatives to find the most relevant features, it requires significant computational resources to generate effective adversarial examples.
Answer: 

Question: Here are the question-answer pairs with the author's style:

**Q1:** What are the most discriminant features in the malware image dataset?
**A1:** The most discriminant features in the malware image dataset are the features that are perturbed to construct an adversarial example for each class. As shown in Table IV, the average number of features perturbed is surprisingly high, which is due to the unique property of the dataset.

=======

**Q2:** Why is the search space for finding the most discriminant features large in the malware image dataset?
**A2:** The search space for finding the most discriminant features is large in the malware image dataset because each feature has a value greater than zero, which is not the case in other standard datasets like MNIST. This unusual property increases the search space, resulting in rapid increase in computational complexity and poor performance of the JSMA attack.

=======

**Q3:** What are the unique challenges that emerge when we give more control of the network to ML and algorithms in CSON?
**A3:** The unique challenges that emerge when we give more control of the network to ML and algorithms in CSON are the adversarial settings that have been assumed in networks before through tools such as game theory.

Question: Here are the question-answer pairs with the author's style:

**Q1: What is network distillation?**
**A1:** Network distillation is a process of training a classifier such that the generation of adversarial examples becomes very difficult.
