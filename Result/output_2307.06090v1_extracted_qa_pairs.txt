**Q1:** What are the challenges in annotating speech emotion data?
**A1:** Annotating speech emotion data is a doubly challenging process. The annotators listen to a speech recording and assign an annotation to a data sample using the pre-defined criteria.

Question: Here are the question-answer pairs with the author's style:

**Q1:** How effective was using ChatGPT for speech emotion recognition tasks?
**A1:** Unfortunately, our initial attempt to utilize ChatGPT for speech emotion recognition proved ineffective, particularly when applied to corpora such as LibriSpeech, which lack emotional variations.

=======

**Q2:** Why did the results of using ChatGPT on LibriSpeech data not meet expectations?
