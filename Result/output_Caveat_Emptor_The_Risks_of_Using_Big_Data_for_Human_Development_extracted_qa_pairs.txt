=======
Answer: 

Question: Here are the question-answer pairs with the author's style:

**Q1: How can researchers avoid excessive generalization error?**
Avoiding excessive generalization error is crucial in machine learning. To achieve this, researchers should focus on the scope of their results and avoid extending scientific findings to the whole population. Regularization is a helpful technique in this regard, as it reduces the number of parameters to fit the model in high-dimensional data, preventing overfitting and keeping the focus on the persistent structure.

=======

**Q2: What are some techniques used to reduce generalization error?**
Apart from regularization, there are several other techniques that can be used to reduce generalization error. These include cross-validation, early stopping, weight sharing, weight restriction, sparsity constraints, and more, depending on the algorithm being used.

=======

**Q3: How can Big Data be improved to reduce bias?**
Big Data is often high-dimensional, conflicting, subjective, redundant, and biased. However, by being aware of these potential biases, we can improve the quality of decisions at the individual, organizational, and community levels. For instance, a study of 1000 major business investments conducted by McKinsey highlights the importance of bias awareness in decision-making.
