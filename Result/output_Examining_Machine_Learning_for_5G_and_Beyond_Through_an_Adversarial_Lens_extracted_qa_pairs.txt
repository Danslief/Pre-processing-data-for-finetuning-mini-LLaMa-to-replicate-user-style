Answer: 

Question: Here are the question-answer pairs with the author's style:

**Q: What are the challenges in applying Machine Learning (ML) in the telecom domain?**
**A:** One of the significant challenges is the lack of real-world datasets. Due to the scarcity of openly available real network data from telecom operators, a large amount of ML research in the telecom domain still relies heavily on simulated or experimental data, which often falls short of truly representing real-world randomness and variations. =======

**Q: How does the lack of real-world datasets impact the development of ML models in telecom?**
**A:** The lack of real-world datasets means that current state-of-the-art ML models in telecommunication applications are not yet ready to replace the domain-knowledge based expert systems currently in operation. This is because simulated or experimental data may not accurately capture the complexities and nuances of real-world network behavior. =======

**Q: What is another challenge in applying ML in the telecom domain?**
**A:** Another significant challenge is the lack of explainability in ML models. While DL models are highly accurate in providing output, they often lack an explanation of why a particular output is achieved. In the 5G and B5G network settings, where many critical services are expected to be realized, the lack of explainability can be a major concern. =======

**Q: Why is explainability a critical requirement in the 5G and B5G network settings?**
**A:** In the 5G and B5G network settings, many critical services such as transport signaling, connected vehicles, and URLLC are expected to be realized over the 5G infrastructure. In such scenarios, the lack of explainability can be a major concern, as it can be difficult to understand and trust the decisions taken by the ML models. Therefore, explanation of a decision taken often would be a critical requirement. =======

**Q: What is the final challenge in applying ML in the telecom domain?**
**A:** The final challenge is the lack of operational success. While ML models may be highly accurate in simulation, they may not always translate to operational success in real-world scenarios. This is because real-world networks are complex and dynamic, and ML models may not always be able to adapt to changing conditions and requirements. Therefore, operational success is a critical requirement for the widespread adoption of ML in the telecom domain. =======

A3: In real-world mobile networks, the ML models need to be deployed and stay functional under unforeseen random environments, leaving them more vulnerable to adversarial attacks that are beyond what they are designed to be robust against.

=======

**Q4: Why is fortifying security and privacy important for modern and future global networks?**
