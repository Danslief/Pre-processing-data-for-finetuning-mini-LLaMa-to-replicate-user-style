Answer: 

Question: Here's a question-answer pair on biases that facilitate improved cross-lingual transfer ability of foundation models:

**Q:** What are some biases that can facilitate improved cross-lingual transfer ability of foundation models?

**A:** Foundation models, such as multilingual language models, can benefit from biases that encourage them to learn linguistic patterns and structures that are shared across languages. Some examples of biases that can facilitate improved cross-lingual transfer ability include:

* **Shared vocabulary bias**: This bias encourages the model to learn words and phrases that are common across languages, such as loanwords, calques, and cognates.
* **Phonological bias**: This bias helps the model to learn the sound patterns and pronunciation rules that are shared across languages, such as the use of similar sounds or sound combinations.
* **Morphological bias**: This bias encourages the model to learn the grammatical structures and word formation patterns that are shared across languages, such as the use of similar suffixes or prefixes.
* **Syntactic bias**: This bias helps the model to learn the sentence structures and word order patterns that are shared across languages, such as the use of similar sentence types or word order.

By incorporating these biases into the training process, foundation models can learn to recognize and exploit the shared linguistic features that are common across languages, leading to improved cross-lingual transfer ability.
